Graduate CS-related enrollment: In the table \u201cOn-Campus Graduate Headcount Enrollment By Program Category (Fall 2024)\u201d, the same CIP 11 row shows UM = 0. This source does not provide a breakdown of CIP 11 graduate enrollment into MS vs PhD, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."
