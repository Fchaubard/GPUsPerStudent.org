    "notes": "Searched for NYU Computer Science (CS) student enrollment counts specifically for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 across: (1) NYU CS department pages (cs.nyu.edu), (2) NYU Common Data Set 2024-2025, (3) NYU registrar/institutional research enrollment statistics, and (4) NYU Tandon dashboards. I found an official NYU Tandon 'Fast Facts' page that clearly reports Fall 2024 total enrollment (7,602 total; 2,852 undergraduate; 4,750 graduate), but it does NOT break enrollment down by Computer Science major/program (so it cannot be used to populate CS-only counts). ([engineering.nyu.edu](https://engineering.nyu.edu/about/fast-facts?utm_source=openai)) I also found an NYU CS PhD overview page mentioning 'Starting Fall 2026' a single CS PhD program comprising 'over 250 full-time Ph.D. students', but it does not provide Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 CS PhD enrollment and is explicitly future-dated (2026), so it was rejected per your date rules.

(TOP500 does not list accelerator count.)\n\n2) Greene-H100 (NYU, TOP500 2024 entry; NVIDIA H100 80GB)\n- TOP500 lists 9,360 CPU cores; AMD EPYC 9454 is a 48-core CPU.\n- Assumed dual-socket nodes: 2\u00d748 = 96 CPU cores per node; nodes \u2248 9,360 / 96 = 97.5, rounded to 98 nodes (possible minor core disablement / reporting mismatch).\n- Lenovo SD665-N V3 datasheet indicates 4 GPUs per node.\n- H100 total estimate: 98 nodes \u00d7 4 H100/node = 392 H100.\n- H100 counted as SXM (HGX) based on SD665-N V3 being an HGX-based 4-GPU platform.\n\n3) Greene (legacy GPU pool; RTX8000 + V100 + A100)\n- From Greene documentation snapshot: total GPU cards explicitly listed: 292 RTX8000 (48GB) and 76 V100 (32GB).\n- RTX8000: treated as 73 nodes \u00d7 4 RTX8000/node = 292 (consistent with the reported 292 RTX8000).\n- V100: treated as 19 nodes \u00d7 4 V100/node = 76 (matches the reported 76 V100; the same page also mentions 20 V100 nodes, which is inconsistent).\n- A100: page mentions 9 A100 GPU nodes but does not report A100 GPU-card count or VRAM size.\n  * Estimate used: 9 nodes \u00d7 4 A100/node = 36 A100.\n  * A100 classified as 40GB (not 80GB) as an age-based/typical-config estimate because VRAM and form factor are not stated.\n\n4) Hudson (incorporated into Greene; AMD MI50)\n- 20 nodes \u00d7 8 MI50/node = 160 MI50 (32GB) recorded under other_high_vram_gpus (not one of the requested explicit NVIDIA categories).\n\nNo evidence found (in accessible sources used here) for NYU-owned A6000/L40S/P100/B100/B200/GH200/H100 PCIe counts; these are set to 0."
