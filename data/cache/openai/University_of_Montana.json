Found an official 'Fall 2024 CENSUS Enrollment Report (Census Day 9/18/2024)' PDF, but it only reports overall UM headcount (undergraduate/graduate/law totals) and does NOT provide enrollment by major/department (no Computer Science, MS CS, or PhD CS counts). Checked UM Computer Science department pages (undergraduate and graduate) and they do not list enrollment counts or term-specific headcounts. Attempted to locate major-level enrollment via UM Institutional Research 'Tableau Infogriz Reports' (external Tableau site), but the Tableau content was not accessible in a way that exposed Fall 2024 CS major headcounts. UM Common Data Set page appears to only list older academic years (2017-2018 and earlier), which is rejected per the 2024+ requirement."
