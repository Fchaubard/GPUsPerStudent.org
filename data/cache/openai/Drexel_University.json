It explicitly includes a 'Fall year (fall snapshot) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025' table and is labeled within the document as '2024-2025 Drexel University Factbook'. Used the 2024 column (Fall 2024 snapshot, census ~6 weeks into fall term) under 'Computing and Informatics' -> 'Baccalaureate Degree' -> 'Computer Science' = 1,607 (undergrad CS majors). Used the 2024 column under the same school for 'Masters Degree' -> 'Computer Science' = 119 (masters/MS-level CS majors) and 'Doctoral Degree' -> 'Computer Science' = 36 (PhD CS majors). Validation: counts are from 2024 column; no 2023-or-earlier-only data used."
