    "notes": "NO 2024+ CS ENROLLMENT COUNTS FOUND. I followed your search order and also tried additional targeted searches for WSU (Washington State University) Computer Science headcount by level (UG / MS / PhD) for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 (including queries for WSU Factbook, registrar enrollment reports, Board of Regents Fall 2024 enrollment report PDFs, and EECS/Voiland College 'at a glance' pages). The most likely official sources appear to be WSU Data and Information dashboards and WSU Institutional Research/Factbook pages, but they were not accessible from this environment: (1) https://data.wsu.edu/system-data/institutional-dashboards/student/new-student-enrollment/ returned 403 Forbidden when opened, and (2) https://ir.wsu.edu/ returned 403 Forbidden when opened. The linked Daily Evergreen article is publicly accessible and confirms a Fall 2024 enrollment dashboard exists, but it does not provide Computer Science major enrollment counts, and the dashboard itself could not be accessed to extract UG/MS/PhD CS counts. Per your rules, I did not use any 2023-or-earlier CS enrollment numbers as substitutes, so all counts are set to 0."
