This figure appears to be the number of new, first-time, first-year students in the Fall 2024 incoming class whose top major is Computer Science (i.e., not total CS majors across all undergraduate years). No Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 source on stjohns.edu found that reports total undergraduate CS majors, MS Computer Science enrollment, or CS PhD enrollment; St. John\u2019s appears not to list a CS PhD program on the pages reviewed, so phd_cs_count is set to 0."

No publicly available St. John's University research computing/HPC GPU cluster specification pages were found in the searched sources (no node counts, GPU-per-node, GPU models, or totals). Therefore, total GPUs for all requested models = 0 and no age-based estimation was applied because no clusters were identified. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
