Those Clemson Box links require JavaScript and did not expose the PDF contents in a way I could verify/extract CS enrollment counts.\n- The Open Clemson repository pages for 'Common Data Set 2024-2025' show Publication Date 1-1-2025, but the actual PDF download is blocked (403), so I could not verify whether it contains CS enrollment-by-program counts.\n- The School of Computing page contains statements like 'current enrollment of more than 1200' (undergraduate) and 'over 400 students' (graduate), but it does not explicitly state 'Fall 2024' or 'AY 2024-2025', so I rejected it per your absolute date requirement.\n- Registrar 'Data and Reporting' indicates 'Enrollment by College and Program' exists but is explicitly marked as a restricted report (not publicly accessible).\n\nBecause no publicly accessible Clemson source I could open provided explicit Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 CS (BS/BA) headcount plus separate MS (masters-only) and PhD counts, all counts are set to 0."

    "notes": "CLUSTERS COUNTED\n\n1) Palmetto 2 (Clemson RCD)\n- Total GPUs: 1,615 (docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/about/).\n- Hopper subset: 10 systems \u00d7 8 GPUs/system = 80 total Hopper GPUs (docs.rcd.clemson.edu/support/fac/).\n  - H100: 5 nodes \u00d7 8 H100/node = 40 H100 (blogs post). Assumed these are SXM/NVLink-style (8-way NVLINK) so counted as H100 SXM.\n  - Remaining Hopper GPUs: 80 - 40 = 40 assumed to be H200 (counted as H200).\n- A100 vs V100 inference for Top500 benchmark hardware mix:\n  - Facilities page states Top500 benchmark used 220 nodes and 2,611,200 accelerator cores with V100 or A100.\n  - Assumption: benchmark nodes had 2 GPUs/node => 220\u00d72=440 GPUs.\n  - Solve for x A100 and y V100 using CUDA-core counts (A100=6912, V100=5120):\n    x + y = 440; 6912x + 5120y = 2,611,200 => x=200 A100, y=240 V100.\n  - Since VRAM split not given, estimated A100 80GB=100 and A100 40GB=100.\n- Remaining Palmetto 2 GPUs after accounting for Hopper (80), A100 (200), and one MI210 (1): 1,615 - 80 - 200 - 1 = 1,334.\n  - Because model breakdown for the remaining GPUs was not found in accessible sources, estimated distribution for remaining GPUs as mostly older-generation NVIDIA (per request guidance):\n    - P100: 135 (estimated)\n    - V100: remaining 1,334 - 135 = 1,199\n  - Also recorded AMD Instinct MI210 count=1 from sinfo example (tracked under other_high_vram_gpus).\n\n2) Secretariat (CU Institute for Human Genetics HPC cluster)\n- DGX system: 1 \u00d7 (8\u00d7 A100 80GB) = 8 A100 80GB.\n- Two R760XA nodes: 2 nodes \u00d7 (H100 NVL 188GB, equivalent to 2\u00d7 H100) = 2\u00d72 = 4 H100. Counted as H100 PCIe (NVL form factor assumption).\n- One R760 node: 1 \u00d7 (2\u00d7 L40S) = 2 L40S.\n\n3) Standalone DGX-2 (listed as a major Clemson system)\n- 1 \u00d7 (16\u00d7 V100) = 16 V100.\n\nTOTALS (sum across clusters)\n- H100 SXM = 40 (Palmetto 2)\n- H100 PCIe = 4 (Secretariat)\n- H200 = 40 (Palmetto 2, assumed)\n- A100 80GB = 100 (Palmetto 2 est.) + 8 (Secretariat) = 108\n- A100 40GB = 100 (Palmetto 2 est.)\n- V100 = 1,199 (Palmetto 2 est.) + 16 (DGX-2) = 1,215\n- P100 = 135 (Palmetto 2 est.)\n- L40S = 2 (Secretariat)\n\nMAJOR ASSUMPTIONS / ESTIMATIONS\n- Palmetto 2: the 80 Hopper GPUs are split as 40\u00d7H100 (from the 'five new nodes' post) and 40\u00d7H200 (remainder), because public sources do not provide the exact H100/H200 split.\n- Palmetto 2: A100 vs V100 counts derived by assuming 2 GPUs/node for the 220 benchmark nodes and interpreting 'accelerator cores' as CUDA cores; this yields 200 A100 and 240 V100.\n- Palmetto 2: remaining GPUs not broken down in public sources were estimated primarily as V100/P100 to satisfy requested categorization; actual Palmetto 2 inventory likely includes additional GPU models (e.g., V100S, K20, K40, L40S, A40) indicated by job-submission documentation but without counts in accessible sources."
