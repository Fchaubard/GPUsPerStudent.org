While it contains various GPU generations (including potential A100s purchased by labs), there is no public verifiable inventory of total node counts. Therefore, TSCC resources are excluded from the integers to ensure accuracy.\n\n5) National Research Platform (NRP/Nautilus): UCSD hosts a significant portion of this distributed cluster (e.g., FIONA nodes), but as it is a multi-institutional resource without a clear 'UCSD-only' partition list, it is excluded to prevent double-counting."
