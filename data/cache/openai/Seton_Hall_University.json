The official 'Fact Books' page shows the newest available Fact Book as '2022-23 Data Trends' (no 2024, 2024-2025, or Fall 2024 links), so any CS major enrollment counts would be older than 2024 and must be rejected per your date requirement. Seton Hall\u2019s Institutional Research 'Reports' page also does not provide recent Common Data Sets (it lists only early-2000s CDS links). Therefore, all counts are set to 0."
