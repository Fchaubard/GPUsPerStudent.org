Undergrad CS: In the 'Undergraduate Programs \u2013 Bachelor\u2019s (2021-2025)' table, the 'Computer Science' row shows 2024 Enrolled = 1846 (with an 'all plans' value shown in parentheses as 1987). Graduate CS: In the 'Graduate Programs \u2013 Master\u2019s and Doctorate (2021-2025)' table, the 'Computer Science' row shows 2024 Enrolled = 247 (parentheses 260), but this row explicitly combines M.S. and Ph.D. ('M.S. and Ph.D.'), so it cannot be split into MS-only vs PhD-only from this source. Therefore grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0, and the combined CS graduate (MS+PhD) headcount for Fall 2024 is 247."
