The official Florida Tech Institutional Research Fall 2024 Official Count Report PDF explicitly references Fall 2024 and Sept 16, 2024 official count timing, but it only reports enrollment by level (Undergraduate/Masters/Doctorate) and by college/location\u2014not by major/department (no Computer Science-specific headcount). Also reviewed the CS department 'Facts about the Department' PDF (cs.fit.edu/media/Facts.pdf), which contains program counts but does not explicitly state 2024/2024-2025/Fall 2024, so it was rejected per requirements. No publicly accessible Florida Tech Factbook/Data Arsenal major-level enrollment tables were found without login, and the CS department 'Enrollment and Graduation Data' link was broken (404). Therefore, CS-specific counts are set to 0."
