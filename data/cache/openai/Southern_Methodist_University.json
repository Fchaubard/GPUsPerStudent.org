Graduate (MS) declared majors: Computer Science - MS (Maj=227); the \"Computer Science - MS - Onlin\" row is blank (0). Doctoral declared majors: Computer Science - PhD (Maj=43). Note: this is a declared academic plans (majors/minors) headcount report; students with multiple plans could be counted in multiple rows. Pre-major CS (Computer Science - PMJ) is listed separately as Pre=148 (not included in undergrad_cs_count)."
