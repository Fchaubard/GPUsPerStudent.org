The only CS/CIS-specific enrollment-related number I could find for 2024+ is: 'the Department of Computer and Information Sciences serves over 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students' (not an exact headcount, not broken down into BS vs MS vs PhD, and not restricted to Computer Science-only vs other CIS programs like Data Science/Informatics). I also checked Temple's official Fact Book 2024-2025 (Fall 2024 enrollment) and Common Data Set 2024-2025, but those sources do not publish Computer Science (major/program) student headcounts by degree level. Per your rules, I rejected 2023 or earlier data and set the requested degree-level CS counts to 0 because no Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 CS-by-degree enrollment counts were publicly available in the sources searched."
