Masters-only CS enrollment (Fall 2024): 'Master of Computer Science' = 47 plus 'Master of Science' -> 'Computer Science' = 2 (total masters = 49). PhD-only CS enrollment (Fall 2024): 'Doctor of Philosophy' -> 'Computer Science' = 52. The PDF does not show a clear 'last updated' date on the extracted text."
