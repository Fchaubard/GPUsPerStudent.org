Counts are estimated baselines from IDRE hardware documentation and OARC capacity statements ('over 500 GPUs'). Breakdown logic: A100s (mix of g4-a100 80GB and g1-a100) estimated at ~124 total. V100s (legacy workhorse) estimated at ~160. A40s (visualization/AI) estimated at ~32. RTX/Consumer cards make up the remainder of the 500+ total. H100s not yet listed in public hardware queues."
