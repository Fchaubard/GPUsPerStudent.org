PhD count taken directly as 26. Page content includes 'Fall 2024' explicitly; no visible 'last updated' date on the page."

Calculations from node counts: H100: 3 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs/node = 12 (counted as H100 SXM due to 'NVLink interconnect' on quad-GPU nodes; form factor not explicitly stated on source page). A100: (2 quad nodes \u00d7 4) + (3 dual nodes \u00d7 2) = 8 + 6 = 14, and A100 described as 40GB => a100_40gb_count=14. A40: 13 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 26. Other listed RCI systems (Hyalite, Snowcrest, Nautilus) did not provide a fixed inventory count of GPUs on public pages, so they are not included in totals."
