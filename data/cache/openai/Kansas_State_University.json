In the row labeled \"Computer Science\", the value under the \"2024\" column is 356 (source noted on the page as \"20th day reports\"). I was not able to find any publicly accessible 2024/Fall 2024 CS graduate (M.S. only) and Ph.D. headcount by program/major; K-State DAIR Quick Facts PDFs provide overall graduate totals and college-level totals but do not provide CS-specific M.S. vs Ph.D. headcounts by major, and the linked \"20th day reports\" area appears to require K-State eID login."
