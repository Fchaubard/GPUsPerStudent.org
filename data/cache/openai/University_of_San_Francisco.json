Found USF's Common Data Set 2024-2025 (includes overall Fall 2024 institutional enrollment totals as of the official fall reporting date/Oct 15, 2024, but does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/department such as Computer Science). Also found USF Quick Facts with Fall Census enrollment dated September 6, 2024 (overall university/college totals only; no Computer Science major headcount). USF's CIPE/OIRA 'Census Reports' page that might contain enrollment-by-major appears to require myUSF login, so CS-major enrollment counts for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 were not publicly accessible in the sources checked. The public BS Computer Science program page contains a '2023 USF Census' statistic (percent women in major), which is pre-2024 and was therefore rejected per your date rules."
