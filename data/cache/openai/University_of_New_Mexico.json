I also identified that UNM\u2019s OIA Official Enrollment Report is a Tableau Public workbook (\u201cUniversity of New Mexico Official Enrollment Report\u201d) and OIA\u2019s OER FAQ explicitly states there is majors data (including a tab for \u201cAlbuquerque Campus Count of Undergraduate Second Majors\u201d), which should contain Fall 2024 major headcounts; however, Tableau Public requires JavaScript and my attempts to access the underlying workbook/major tables were blocked/rate-limited (\u201c503 Slow Down\u201d), so I could not verify any Fall 2024 CS headcount numbers that explicitly meet your 2024+/Fall 2024 requirement. Therefore, I am returning 0s."

No SXM vs PCIe given; estimated as PCIe because described as a mixed-use Dell CPU/GPU cluster rather than DGX-style SXM systems.\n- Calculation: total GPUs = 32 (given explicitly). Allocated: H100 PCIe = 32.\n\n2) Xena (CARC): Source states 32 nodes, but does not provide GPUs per node or GPU model. UNM Newsroom article indicates it was coming online in early 2015 (older generation). Per instruction, estimated model as Tesla K80-era hardware.\n- Assumption for node configuration (not stated in sources): 2x Tesla K80 cards per node; each K80 card contains 2 GPUs => 4 GPUs per node.\n- Calculation: 32 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs/node = 128 total GPUs (estimated as Tesla K80 GPUs; reported under other_high_vram_gpus because K80 is not one of the requested fixed fields).\n\nNo UNM sources located in the provided searches that specify any A100/H200/V100/P100/A6000/L40S counts on other UNM clusters (e.g., Taos/Hopper), so those totals are left at 0."
