    "notes": "Searched for Biola University Computer Science (CS) student ENROLLMENT headcount specifically for AY 2024-2025 or Fall 2024. The Biola Academic Catalog 'General Information' page contains an explicit 'Summary of University Enrollment \u2014 Fall Semester 2024' (and the catalog itself states it is effective beginning September 2, 2025), but it only reports university-wide totals and does NOT provide enrollment by major/department (so no CS-major headcount is available there). The official B.S. in Computer Science program page (https://www.biola.edu/degrees/u/computer-science-bs) does not list the number of currently-enrolled CS majors. Biola's School of Science, Technology and Health academics page (https://www.biola.edu/science/academics) lists the school's master's programs (MPH, M.S. Speech-Language Pathology) and does not list an M.S. in Computer Science, supporting grad_cs_count=0 for CS (masters only) and phd_cs_count=0 for CS, but it still does not provide CS enrollment headcounts. Biola University Analytics provides Common Data Set links (including 2024-25 and 2025-26) at https://www.biola.edu/university-analytics/reports, but the Google Sheets were not accessible in this environment in a way that allowed extracting the CS-specific counts. Because no official source found/published a CS-major enrollment headcount labeled Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25, all CS counts are set to 0 per your rules."
