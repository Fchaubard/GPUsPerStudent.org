The most relevant official source located was UCSC IRAPS 'Major Demand Trends' (linked as 'Major Counts' from UCSC Budget Analysis & Planning Reporting page), but the page content is an interactive data visualization and does not expose the underlying 2024/Fall 2024 major-level counts (including Computer Science) in the static HTML accessible during retrieval. No alternative official UCSC page/PDF/CSV found that explicitly lists Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 CS major headcount split into undergrad vs MS vs PhD. Because no explicit 2024+ CS enrollment counts were retrievable from a working source page, all counts are set to 0. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

GPU model not specified in public announcement; estimated as H100 SXM (8) based on being newly commissioned in 2025/2026 and typical 8-GPU HPC node configurations.\n- Nautilus (NRP) is a distributed external platform accessible to UCSC users; public UCSC ITS page provides no counts/specs to convert into nodes\u00d7GPUs/node, so it is not included in totals.\nNon-UCSC 'Sherlock 728 GPUs' references are to Stanford and are excluded."
