Found an official IRP infographic explicitly labeled \u201c2024 Quick Facts\u201d and \u201cFall 2024\u201d (source_url), but the publicly accessible version available during this lookup did not provide CS-major headcount with MS vs PhD breakdown. Also found an official IRP \u201cEnrollment by Major\u201d dashboard that includes AY 2024-2025 and breaks out MS vs PhD, but it is scoped to College of Engineering majors and does not include the Computer Science major. Because no authoritative Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 CS-major headcount (UG vs MS vs PhD) could be retrieved from an accessible official page, all counts are set to 0."
