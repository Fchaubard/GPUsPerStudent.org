    "notes": "I found Widener University\u2019s official Common Data Set labeled \"2024/25\" (dated August 2025) which explicitly reports institutional enrollment \"as of ... October 15, 2024\" (Fall 2024 reference date). However, this CDS does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/program (e.g., Computer Science headcount), only overall undergraduate/graduate totals and other non-major breakdowns. I also checked Widener\u2019s Computer Science & Computer Information Systems Department page and the Computer Science/Computer Information Systems major page, but neither contains a Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 student enrollment count for CS. Because no official Widener source with a 2024+ timestamped CS-specific enrollment headcount was located, counts are set to 0 per your rules. Searches performed (in your requested order/intent): \"Widener University computer science enrollment Fall 2024\", \"Widener University CS department facts 2024\", \"Widener University Common Data Set 2024-2025\", \"Widener University registrar enrollment statistics 2024\", and site-focused queries for enrollment/major counts on widener.edu."
