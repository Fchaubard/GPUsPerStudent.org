Individual departments (Robotics, LTI, Auton Lab) operate private clusters (e.g., 'Auton', 'LTI Cluster') known to contain A6000s/A100s, but they do not publish auditable node counts or hardware lists publicly. Only the shared PSC resources are verifiable. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

  "analysis_notes": "CMU presents a unique data challenge: while it is a top AI university, it does not have a single 'Research Computing' center with a unified hardware list like Stanford or Princeton. Instead, it relies on the semi-external PSC (Bridges-2) and opaque private departmental clusters. The V100 count is accurate for the shared resource, but likely significantly undercounts the total hardware physically present in private labs (LTI/Robotics)."
