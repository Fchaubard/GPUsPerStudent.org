Found an official 2024-2025 Common Data Set PDF (URL contains date 2025-10-14) that reports institutional enrollment totals as of the official fall reporting date / October 15, 2024 (e.g., total all undergraduates = 12,276; total all graduate = 2,200), but it does NOT provide enrollment/headcount by major or by program (no CS/Computer Science major enrollment counts, MS CS headcount, or PhD CS headcount). Attempted to locate UVM OIRA/Catamount Factbook enrollment-by-program/major dashboards for Fall 2024; the relevant 'Enrollment by Program' dashboards are labeled 'Access Level: UVM Affiliates' (not public), so CS program-specific enrollment could not be retrieved from public sources. Therefore, per instructions, all CS counts are set to 0 due to no publicly available CS enrollment headcount explicitly labeled for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25."
