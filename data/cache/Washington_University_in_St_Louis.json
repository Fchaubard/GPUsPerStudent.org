Found a CSE page listing \"CSE quick facts\" (737 undergraduate students, 217 graduate students, 100 PhD students), but the page does NOT explicitly state \"Fall 2024\", \"2024\", or \"2024-2025\", so those numbers were rejected per your date rules. Checked the official WashU Common Data Set 2024-2025 PDF (https://washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/06/2024-2025-WashU-CDS.pdf), which is labeled 2024-2025 and reports overall enrollment as of Oct 15, 2024, but it does not provide Computer Science major/program enrollment counts; sections with program/major figures are for degrees awarded in 2023-2024 and were rejected. Checked the Registrar Fall 2024 10th-week enrollment PDF (https://registrar.washu.edu/app/uploads/2024/11/Fall-2024-10th-week-enrollment.pdf), which is explicitly Fall 2024, but it reports enrollment by school/division/award level, not Computer Science program/major counts. No source meeting your explicit 2024+ labeling requirement was found for CS undergrad/MS/PhD headcounts."
