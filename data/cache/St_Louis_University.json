The only official SLU source that appears to contain current enrollment data is SLU Office of Institutional Research (OIR) \u201cStudent Enrollment Dashboard\u201d (linked from OIR Institutional Data), but the dashboard\u2019s underlying data/visuals are embedded and not accessible as extractable text, and OIR\u2019s \u201cFinal Census Reports\u201d are hosted on a restricted Google Site requiring SLUNet login. I did not find any publicly accessible SLU page that explicitly states Fall 2024 (or AY 2024-2025) Computer Science enrollment counts split by undergraduate / MS / PhD. Per your rule rejecting 2023 or earlier, I did not use older Common Data Set pages (e.g., 2021-2022) or third-party enrollment sites."
