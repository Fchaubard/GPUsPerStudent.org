    "notes": "Searched for Caltech Computer Science (CS) student enrollment counts specifically for AY 2024-2025 / Fall 2024 and found no official public page reporting CS headcount by level (undergrad CS majors, MS-only, PhD-only). The official Common Data Set PDF is explicitly labeled \"Common Data Set 2024-2025\" (dated May 2025) and includes overall institutional enrollment totals (e.g., B1 references the official fall reporting date / Oct 15, 2024), but it does NOT provide CS-major enrollment headcounts. Caltech\u2019s IRO 'Data Dashboards' appear to require Caltech login (not publicly accessible) and the Registrar 'Enrollment Statistics' page currently shows overall fall enrollment for 2025-26 (not CS-specific, and not Fall 2024). Therefore all CS-specific counts are set to 0 to comply with the requirement to avoid using non-2024+ or non-CS-specific numbers."
