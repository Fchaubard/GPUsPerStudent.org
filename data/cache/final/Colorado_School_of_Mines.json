    "notes": "Searched exactly per your required strategy for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 CS enrollment counts (UG, MS-only, PhD-only). Colorado School of Mines' official Institutional Research 'Common Data Set' page only lists CDS files up through 2022-2023 (older than your allowed window), so it was rejected. The IR 'Data Visualizations' page lists dashboards (e.g., 'Enrollment' and 'Fall Census Student Profiles') and an '2017-2018 to Present Enrollment Report' link, but I could not retrieve any Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 CS headcount figures from a publicly accessible page/PDF that explicitly states 'Fall 2024' or '2024-2025' and contains CS enrollment-by-level numbers. Therefore, to comply with your rejection rule for 2023-and-earlier data, all counts are set to 0."
