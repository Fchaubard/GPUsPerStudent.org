    "notes": "Verified this is AY 2024-2025 (document titled 'Common Data Set 2024-2025' and dated May 2025). In Section B1 'Institutional Enrollment - Men and Women', Caltech reports total institutional enrollment as of October 15, 2024 (Fall 2024 reporting date): Total Undergraduate Students = 987; Total Graduate Students = 1,443; Total All Students = 2,430. However, the CDS does NOT provide enrollment headcounts by major/option/department (e.g., Computer Science), and no CS-specific undergraduate/PhD enrollment totals were found in this 2024-2025 CDS. Additional searches on Caltech Registrar and CMS/CS pages did not yield any Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 CS-major headcount table. Therefore CS-specific counts were originally set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count=250, grad_cs_count=150, phd_cs_count=75 are estimated based on Caltech's size and reputation as a top research university. Will contact university for accurate data."
