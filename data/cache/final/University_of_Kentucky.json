The same table lists Spring Enrollment for AY 2024-25 as 550. The page notes that some first-year students enter undeclared and are not included in the individual program counts. This source does not provide a breakdown of graduate enrollment into MS vs PhD for 2024-2025, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."
