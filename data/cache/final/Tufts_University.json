Found Tufts Common Data Set 2024-2025 (official fall reporting date referenced as of Oct 15, 2024), but it reports institution-wide enrollment totals and does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/department (e.g., Computer Science) or by CS degree level (MS vs PhD). ([provost.tufts.edu](https://provost.tufts.edu/institutionalresearch/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/CDS_2024-2025-1.pdf)) Also checked Tufts OIR Fact Book 'Enrollment' page (dashboard; not exposed in the accessible page content, and no CS-by-major table visible without the interactive dashboard). ([provost.tufts.edu](https://provost.tufts.edu/institutionalresearch/fact-book-enrollment/)) Checked OIR 'Top Undergraduate Majors' page, but it is explicitly for graduates in AY 2022-2023 (rejected as pre-2024). ([provost.tufts.edu](https://provost.tufts.edu/institutionalresearch/top-undergraduate-majors/)) Looked for department/CS-site 'facts/at-a-glance' style pages listing current CS majors / MS / PhD headcounts and did not find any 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 CS headcount figures on publicly accessible pages. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data.
