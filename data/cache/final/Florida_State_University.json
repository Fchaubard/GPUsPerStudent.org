In the 'Computer Science' row for Fall 2024: L (lower-division undergrad)=301, U (upper-division undergrad)=1,061, G (graduate, not separated by degree level)=229, Total=1,591. Undergrad_cs_count is computed as L+U=1,362. The PDF does not break the 229 graduate headcount into MS vs PhD for Computer Science, so grad_cs_count (MS-only) and phd_cs_count are set to 0 rather than misclassifying the combined graduate total. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count=229 and phd_cs_count=50 are estimated based on the total graduate student count and typical PhD proportion. Will contact university for accurate data."
