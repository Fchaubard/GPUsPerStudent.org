I did not find any explicit 2024/2024-2025/Fall 2024 headcount numbers for M.S.-only or Ph.D.-only CS students on publicly accessible pages; the department links to a CS Graduate Program Guide hosted on Box, but the Box share page requires JavaScript and could not be accessed in this environment, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."
