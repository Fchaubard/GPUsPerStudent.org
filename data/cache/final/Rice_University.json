Found an official Rice/Registrar-sourced Tableau Public dashboard titled \"FALL ENROLLMENT BY MAJOR/PROGRAM - SNAPSHOT\", but the accessible published view rendered with the term set to \"Fall 2025\" (and showed CS counts for Fall 2025), which does NOT meet the user's absolute date requirement (must be Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25). Therefore, all counts are set to 0 and the Fall 2025 numbers are rejected.
