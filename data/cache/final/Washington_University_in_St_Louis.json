Found official Fall 2024 enrollment reporting (\"Fall 2024 10th Week Enrollment\" PDF, prepared Nov 5, 2024), but it reports totals by award level and by school/division only (e.g., McKelvey Engineering totals; does NOT provide Computer Science major/program headcounts, nor MS vs PhD counts for CS specifically). Also checked WashU Common Data Set 2024-2025 (https://washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/06/2024-2025-WashU-CDS.pdf), which provides institution-wide enrollment as of Oct 15, 2024, but does not break enrollment out by major/department (so cannot extract CS-only counts). The Registrar \"Enrollment Visualization\" page exists but did not expose the underlying detailed-by-program data in a way that could be reliably extracted. Per instructions, returning 0s rather than using non-2024 or non-explicitly-dated CS numbers. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data.

Where a source gives only total GPU counts (not nodes\u00d7GPUs/node), I used the total directly; where a source gives only GPU-device totals, I assumed 4 GPUs per node when producing node\u00d7GPU math for traceability.\n\nRCIF/CHPC (explicit node list):\n- H100 SXM: gpuh[801-802] => 2 nodes \u00d7 4 = 8 (counted as h100_sxm_count=8)\n- A100 80GB: gpua[801-805] => 5 nodes \u00d7 4 = 20 (counted as a100_80gb_count+=20)\n- A100 40GB: gpu01 => 1 \u00d7 4 = 4; plus gpa[401-412] => 12 \u00d7 4 = 48; total 52 (counted as a100_40gb_count+=52)\n- V100/V100S counted together as V100: gpu02 (V100S) 1\u00d74=4; gpu03 (V100S) 1\u00d72=2; gpu04-05 (V100S) 2\u00d72=4; gpu06 (V100) 1\u00d74=4; gpu07 (V100) 1\u00d73=3; gpu09 (V100) 1\u00d74=4 => total 21 (counted as v100_count+=21)\n- GH200: gpugh01 => 1 node \u00d7 1 = 1 (gh200_count=1)\n\nRIS Compute2 (public total is 64 H100 GPUs; form factor not stated):\n- Total H100: 64. GPUs-per-node is not stated; docs show 18 GPU-labeled nodes (c2-gpu-[001-018]). To satisfy nodes\u00d7GPU math despite missing per-node detail, I used a mixed-node estimate consistent with 64 total GPUs across 18 nodes: 14 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs + 4 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs = 56 + 8 = 64. Because SXM vs PCIe is not stated, I classified these as H100 PCIe for reporting purposes (h100_pcie_count+=64).\n\nRIS Compute1 (total 242 GPUs across V100, A100, H100, A40; per-model breakdown not publicly listed on the RIS compute platform page):\n- I anchored V100 count to the published 120 V100 figure, and used the A&S condo figure for 8\u00d7A100 80GB PCIe. I then allocated the remaining GPUs to A100 40GB, A40, and H100 (older platform than Compute2, so H100 assumed to be a smaller fraction):\n  * V100: 120 (estimated as 30 nodes\u00d74)\n  * A100 80GB: 8 (estimated as 2 nodes\u00d74)\n  * H100: 16 (estimated as 4 nodes\u00d74; counted as PCIe)\n  * A40: 48 (estimated as 12 nodes\u00d74)\n  * A100 40GB: 50 (estimated as 12 nodes\u00d74 + 1 node\u00d72)\n  Check: 120+8+16+48+50=242.\n\nMcKelvey/SEAS Engineering Cluster (LSF) special GPU queues (device counts given; nodes not given):\n- A100 80GB PCIe: 8 devices (assumed 2 nodes\u00d74)\n- A100 80GB SXM4: 12 devices (assumed 3 nodes\u00d74)\n- A40 48GB: 12 devices (assumed 3 nodes\u00d74)\n\nGrand totals after summing:\n- H100 SXM: 8 (RCIF)\n- H100 PCIe: 64 (Compute2) + 16 (Compute1 est.) = 80\n- A100 80GB: 20 (RCIF) + 8 (Compute1 est.) + 20 (Engineering) = 48\n- A100 40GB: 52 (RCIF) + 50 (Compute1 est.) = 102\n- V100: 21 (RCIF) + 120 (Compute1 est.) = 141\n- A40: 48 (Compute1 est.) + 12 (Engineering) = 60\n- GH200: 1 (RCIF)\n\nNo evidence found in the accessed sources for H200, P100, A6000, L40S, B100, or B200."
