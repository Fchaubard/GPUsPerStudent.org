This is an undergraduate count (juniors+seniors majoring in Computer Science) for AY 2024-25. NOT FOUND (2024+): I did not find a Princeton-published 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 source that explicitly provides Computer Science graduate enrollment split into master's-only vs PhD-only headcounts; multiple official pages route to Tableau dashboards for enrollment-by-field, but the Tableau views were not accessible in this retrieval session, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count were set to 0 per instructions. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on R1 university size. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on R1 university size.
