    "notes": "I followed your required search priority and restricted acceptance to sources explicitly labeled 2024-25 / Fall 2024. I found an official College of Computing page explicitly labeled \"Enrollment (Fall 2024)\" (Total students: 1,189; Undergraduate: 918; Graduate: 271), but it does NOT break enrollment down by major/program (Computer Science vs other computing majors) and does NOT split graduate enrollment into MS vs PhD, so it cannot be used to produce CS-only counts. ([mtu.edu](https://www.mtu.edu/computing/about/college/facts/)) I then tried Michigan Tech Institutional Research's 2024-25 Fact Book (which is the most likely place to have enrollment-by-major), but the Fact Book's downloadable files are .xlsx and the web tool failed to fetch them (HTTP error shown by the tool), so I could not extract Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 Computer Science headcount by level (BS vs MS vs PhD). ([mtu.edu](https://www.mtu.edu/institutional-research/fact-book/)) I also attempted the Common Data Set 2024-2025, but its downloadable file is also .xlsx and likewise could not be fetched by the tool. ([mtu.edu](https://www.mtu.edu/institutional-research/cds/)) Finally, I attempted the Institutional Research public enrollment dashboard/BI portal, but it renders as a non-text/embedded interface and did not expose the underlying Fall 2024 major-level numbers in a parsable way. ([mtu.edu](https://www.mtu.edu/institutional-research/university-dashboards/)) Because I could not locate any accessible 2024+ source that explicitly provides Computer Science (CS) student enrollment counts broken out into Undergraduate vs MS vs PhD, all requested counts are set to 0 (rather than using older data, which you prohibited)."
