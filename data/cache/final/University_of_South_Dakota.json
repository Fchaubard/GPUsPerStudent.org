    "notes": "Searched for University of South Dakota (USD) Computer Science (CS) student enrollment counts specifically for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 (rejecting 2023 and earlier). Found USD Common Data Set explicitly labeled 'Common Data Set 2024-2025' and referencing Fall 2024 / October 15, 2024 for institutional totals, but it only provides overall undergraduate/graduate totals and does NOT provide CS-major headcount/enrollment by program or degree level (BS vs MS vs PhD). Also attempted to use South Dakota Board of Regents (SDBOR) Factbook PDFs (likely to include program/major enrollments) but those PDFs could not be retrieved via the web tool (requests failed). USD CS department and accreditation pages mention that enrollment data are published annually but do not display the actual enrollment numbers for Fall 2024/AY 2024-2025 on accessible pages. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on similar sized state universities. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on similar sized state universities. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on similar sized state universities. Will contact university for accurate data."
