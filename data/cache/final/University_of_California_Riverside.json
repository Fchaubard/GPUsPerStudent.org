    "notes": "FOUND 2024-DATED SOURCE but it does NOT report CS major headcount totals. The PDF is titled \"Enrollment Overview \u2014 Fall 2024\" and includes overall campus totals (e.g., total enrolled, undergrad, graduate) and includes \"Computer Science\" only as a labeled item in the \"New Undergraduates by Program, Fall 2024\" and \"New Graduates by Program, Fall 2024\" charts, without providing the Computer Science enrollment counts needed (and it does not separate MS-only vs PhD-only CS enrollment). I also located UCR Institutional Research's \"Enrollment: Programs\" page (last updated Oct 24, 2025) that offers downloadable \"Enrollment by program\" data, but the download endpoint returned an error (HTTP 400) when accessed via the available link format, so I could not retrieve the Fall 2024 CS headcount breakdown. Because no explicit CS enrollment headcounts for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 were accessible in a source that clearly states 2024+ AND includes the required CS counts by level, all counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count=250, grad_cs_count=120, phd_cs_count=60 are estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data."
