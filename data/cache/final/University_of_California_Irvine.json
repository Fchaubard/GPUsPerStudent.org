Found an official UC Irvine General Catalogue archived copy labeled \"2024-25 Edition\" at the source_url, but this page does not contain CS student headcount figures (undergrad/MS/PhD) and I was unable to reach a 2024-25 Computer Science department page that explicitly lists CS student counts. I also found CS student-count language on the UCI Catalogue \"Department of Computer Science\" page, but it is explicitly labeled \"2025-26 Edition\" and therefore was rejected per your date constraints. No other official UCI sources located in this run explicitly stating Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 CS headcounts. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on UCI's size and CS department ranking. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on UCI's size and CS department ranking. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on UCI's size and CS department ranking. Will contact university for accurate data."
