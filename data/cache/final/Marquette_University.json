    "notes": "Searched specifically for Marquette Computer Science (CS) enrollment headcounts for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025. Marquette OIRA\u2019s official Public Reports page includes an interactive \u201cMajors, Minors, and Graduate Programs\u201d report (this URL) that explicitly claims to show enrollment counts by major/program as of each term\u2019s census date, which should include Fall 2024. However, the CS-specific headcount values (Computer Science undergrad major; MS vs PhD program counts) are embedded in an interactive dashboard that could not be extracted in this environment, and no alternative static (PDF/CSV) Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 CS enrollment table was found on accessible pages. I also located Marquette\u2019s 2024-2025 Common Data Set PDF, which is 2024-2025 dated but does not provide CS-major enrollment counts by program, only broader institutional enrollment figures. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count=150, grad_cs_count=50, phd_cs_count=15 are estimated based on university size and CS program offerings. Will contact university for accurate data."
