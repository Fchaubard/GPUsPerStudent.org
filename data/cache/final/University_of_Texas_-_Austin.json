However, the page does NOT provide Fall 2024 (or AY 2024-25) Computer Science enrollment headcounts broken out by (1) undergraduate CS majors, (2) on-campus MS/Masters CS students, and (3) CS PhD students. The page does include a single combined figure ('7,600 undergrad + graduate students'), but it is not explicitly labeled as Fall 2024 enrollment and it also does not separate MS vs PhD, so I rejected using it for the required fields and left all counts as 0. I also checked UT Austin IRRIS/Reports pages (Common Data Set and Trends in Student Data) but could not access a Fall 2024 CS-major enrollment table (MS vs PhD vs undergrad) from those pages without the interactive dashboard data being directly visible as text."

Calculation: 600 nodes \u00d7 1 GPU/node = 600 H100 (SXM-equivalent).
