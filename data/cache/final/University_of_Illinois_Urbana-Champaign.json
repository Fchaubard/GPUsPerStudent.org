C3SR Cluster also contains 12 P100s (Wei: 3 nodes * 4). IMPORTANT EXCLUSION: UIUC hosts the NCSA 'Delta' (A100/A40) and 'DeltaAI' (H100) supercomputers. These are excluded from this count because they are NSF-funded national resources (ACCESS-CI) available to external researchers, fitting the exclusion criteria for 'accessible to other universities'. Campus Cluster A100/A40 counts are not publicly enumerated on the specs page."
