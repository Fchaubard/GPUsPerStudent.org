This PDF does not provide CS-specific graduate enrollment (MS vs PhD) counts for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."

Counted all A100s as a100_80gb_count=10 and a100_40gb_count=0.\n\nDiscrepancy note: the Discovery Overview page summarizes '12 V100 GPUs', but the detailed node hardware table lists 4 V100 nodes (p01-p04) with 4 V100 each (=16). Used the detailed node table (16) for totals.\n\nNo Dartmouth sources found indicating any H100/H200/B100/B200/GH200/A6000/P100/A40 GPUs in Dartmouth-owned research computing clusters on the pages retrieved."
