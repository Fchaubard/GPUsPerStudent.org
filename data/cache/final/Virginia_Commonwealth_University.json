This page does not provide (and I could not locate in other publicly accessible VCU pages with explicit 2024/AY 2024-25 labeling) separate enrollment headcounts for M.S. (masters-only) or Ph.D. Computer Science students for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count=150 and phd_cs_count=50 are estimated based on university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data."
