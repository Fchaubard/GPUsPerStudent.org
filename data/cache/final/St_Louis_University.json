Found SLU Office of Institutional Research \u2018Student Enrollment Dashboard\u2019 page, but the dashboard contents are not visible/extractable (page says to contact oir@slu.edu if not visible), so I could not retrieve CS major headcounts from it. ([slu.edu](https://www.slu.edu/provost/office-of-institutional-research/institutional-data/student-enrollment.php)) Also found SLU\u2019s \u2018SLU Profile\u2019 PDF published January 2025 with overall Fall 2024 total enrollment (15,334) and overall undergrad/graduate totals, but it does NOT provide Computer Science (major/program) enrollment counts, so it cannot be used for the requested CS counts. ([slu.edu](https://www.slu.edu/about/key-facts/slu-profile.pdf)) Looked for a Common Data Set 2024-2025 on slu.edu; only older CDS pages (e.g., 2021-2022) were readily discoverable, which are disallowed by your 2024+ requirement. ([slu.edu](https://www.slu.edu/provost/office-of-institutional-research/institutional-data/2122cds.php?utm_source=openai)) ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data."

Classified as H100 PCIe based on typical Dell PowerEdge R750 GPU support (no SXM/HGX details given).\n\nNot included in totals due to missing public GPU counts/models:\n- SLU campuswide 'Libra' HPC cluster (installed/tested summer 2025) mentions GPU nodes but no GPU inventory/counts on the public page.\n- SLU 'Aries' cluster description (on SLU School of Medicine page) does not list GPUs; treated as 0 GPUs for this tally."
