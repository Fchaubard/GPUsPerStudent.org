CS-specific counts come from the \u201cEnrollment by Department and Program\u201d \u2192 \u201cFall 2024\u201d table, row \u201cComputer Science\u201d: Foundational=471, Bachelor\u2019s=451, Master\u2019s=467, Doctoral=83, Total=1472. Reported undergrad_cs_count = Foundational + Bachelor\u2019s = 471 + 451 = 922. grad_cs_count is Master\u2019s only (467). phd_cs_count is Doctoral only (83). Note: the department-level row \u201cDepartment of Computer Science\u201d includes Master\u2019s=476 because it also includes Software Engineering (Master\u2019s=9); this JSON uses the program row \u201cComputer Science\u201d only."
