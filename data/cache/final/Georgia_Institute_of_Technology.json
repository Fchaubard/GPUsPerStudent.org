On-campus Master's count (1,232) is calculated by subtracting the OMSCS enrollment (16,609) and Ph.D. enrollment (462) from the total College of Computing graduate enrollment (18,303) as reported for Spring 2025. This ensures the count accurately reflects the residential student population sharing physical hardware resources."

A100 (24 80GB + 8 40GB) and V100 (80) counts remain consistent with latest PACE inventory reports.\n\nTotal H200 = 144 (Makerspace) + 40 (Phoenix) = 184."
