    "notes": "Searched for University of Georgia CS enrollment numbers specifically labeled Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 (per your requirement). The only directly published, program-specific CS enrollment figure I could locate is an ABET-linked PDF titled \"Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BS-CS) Enrollment and Graduation Statistics\". However, it only lists enrollment through Academic Year 2023-2024 (e.g., 2023-2024: 1572 full-time enrolled students) and does NOT contain any Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025 enrollment values. Per your rules, I rejected this source-year and set all counts to 0. I was also unable to find any public 2024-2025 / Fall 2024 MS-only and PhD-only CS headcount breakdowns for UGA (separately) from accessible official sources."
