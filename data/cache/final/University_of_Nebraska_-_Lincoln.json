The table explicitly lists \"Enrollment (Fall 2024)\" and shows \"Computer Science (Lincoln) *\" = 704 students (note on page: \"* Includes Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management\"). I did not find any CS-specific Fall 2024 headcount on the same page for M.S.-only or Ph.D.-only enrollment, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0. (I could not verify a 'last updated' date because the page did not expose it in the snippet I retrieved.) [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

GPUs/node not explicitly stated in partitions list; inferred as 2 GPUs/node to match common HCC inventory patterns => 2\u00d72=4.\n- A6000: guest_gpu shows 3 A6000 nodes (1 + 2). GPUs/node not explicitly stated; inferred as 8 GPUs/node (3\u00d78=24).\n- H100: guest_gpu shows 2 H100 nodes (one labeled gpu_94gb, one labeled gpu_80gb). Total GPUs not explicitly stated; inferred as 3 total H100 PCIe-class GPUs (94GB node assumed 1 GPU; 80GB node assumed 2 GPUs) => 3. Counted as PCIe because SXM vs PCIe is not specified in HCC docs.\n- V100 family: V100 16GB nodes: gpu partition has 1 node; GPUs/node from submitting_gpu_jobs (4) => 1\u00d74=4. V100 32GB nodes: gpu partition has 11 nodes and guest_gpu has 19 nodes => 30 nodes; GPUs/node from submitting_gpu_jobs (2) => 30\u00d72=60. Total V100-family GPUs = 4+60=64.\n- P100: gpu partition has 5 P100 nodes and guest_gpu has 1 P100 node => 6 nodes; GPUs/node not specified; assumed 1 GPU/node (older/low-core nodes) => 6\u00d71=6.\n\nAI makerspace (Scott Data partnership): 1 server \u00d7 8 H100 GPUs = 8. H100 SXM vs PCIe not specified; assumed SXM (typical 8-GPU HGX-style servers) and counted as H100 SXM.\n\nNot counted as deployed inventory: H200 is mentioned as an upcoming addition in some HCC materials, but no H200 nodes appear in the Swan partitions list (generated 2025-12-13), so h200_count=0."
