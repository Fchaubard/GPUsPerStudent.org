The row for Enrollment Year 2024 lists Fall Enrollment = 620 (explicitly tied to Fall enrollment for that year). No 2024+ source on sc.edu that explicitly lists Computer Science M.S. (masters-only) headcount or Computer Science Ph.D. headcount was found; the official Fall 2024 enrollment PDF link on the university's Enrollment Data (2024) page is hosted on oiraa.dw.sc.edu but was not retrievable due to repeated timeouts, and the Data Dashboards/Table Generator pages did not provide program-level graduate/PhD headcounts in a crawlable format."
