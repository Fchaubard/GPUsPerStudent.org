    "notes": "Source is a USF Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Computing 'Our College by the numbers' graphic that explicitly references AY 2024-25. It reports 'Approximately 2,600 Undergraduate Students' and 'Approximately 400 Graduate Students' (and shows degree-award counts for AY 2024-25). It does NOT break graduate enrollment into MS-only vs PhD-only, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0 to avoid misreporting. Also, the graphic appears to summarize the computing unit broadly (not strictly the Computer Science major only), so the undergraduate count may include multiple computing programs."
