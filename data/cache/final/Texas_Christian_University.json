    "notes": "Searched for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 Computer Science (CS) major enrollment counts (UG / MS / PhD) at TCU via (1) TCU CS department pages, (2) TCU Institutional Research Fact Book, (3) registrar/enrollment reports, and (4) the TCU Common Data Set. Found an official 'Common Data Set 2024-2025' PDF (explicitly labeled '2024-2025' and marked 'TCU Institutional Research rev. 5.29.25'). It reports overall institutional enrollment for the fall reporting date / 'as of October 15, 2024' (e.g., total undergraduates 11,049; total graduate 1,889; grand total 12,938) but does NOT provide enrollment by major/department, so CS-specific student counts cannot be extracted. TCU Fact Book appears to be hosted on Tableau (public.tableau.com) and was not accessible in a non-interactive format during this search, preventing retrieval of CS-major headcounts for Fall 2024. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program presence. Will contact university for accurate data."

Per instruction to estimate when unknown, assumed a minimal single-node HGX-style AI server deployment typical of Dell AI Factory marketing (1 node \u00d7 8 GPUs/node = 8) and classified as H100 SXM (Dell PowerEdge XE9680 commonly uses 8x H100 SXM/HGX). No evidence found to justify >1 node or to select H200/A100/L40S specifically, so kept counts conservative.\nTotals: H100 SXM = 8; all other listed GPU categories = 0."
