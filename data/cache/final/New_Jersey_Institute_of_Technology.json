Interpreting the BA,BS column as BA=3 and BS=1697 gives undergrad_cs_count = 3 + 1697 = 1700. Page states these enrollment numbers are a snapshot (typically third week of Fall semester classes).

Per your instruction, calculations above primarily use nodes*GPUs_per_node; entries with missing/blank model or inconsistent totals were kept as 'unknown' and not forced into the requested GPU model buckets."
