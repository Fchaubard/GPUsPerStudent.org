    "notes": "Searched for CS student enrollment counts explicitly labeled Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 and did not find any public Brown source that provides CS-only enrollment by level (undergrad vs MS vs PhD). Verified Brown OIR Common Data Set 2024-2025 (as of Oct 15, 2024) is available, but it reports only institution-wide enrollment totals (not Computer Science-specific). Also checked OIR Factbooks (Enrollment Factbook) and Brown CS department pages (undergrad concentration pages; CS Master\u2019s handbook; Graduate Programs CS PhD page) and none of these pages publicly list CS student headcounts with an explicit Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 label. Because the requirement was CS-only enrollment with explicit 2024/2024-25 dating, all counts are set to 0."
