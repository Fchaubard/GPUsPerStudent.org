Princeton\u2019s Office of Institutional Research 'Majors' page indicates an 'Undergraduate Degree Majors 2020-2021 through 2024-2025' dataset, but it is hosted on tableaupublic.princeton.edu and returns an 'Unexpected Error' page (no extractable 2024-2025 counts for Computer Science concentrators/majors). The Registrar\u2019s 'University Enrollment Statistics' page similarly points to Tableau views that error. Princeton\u2019s Common Data Set 2024-2025 (https://ir.princeton.edu/document/556) provides overall undergraduate/graduate headcounts as of Oct 15, 2024, but does NOT break enrollment down by Computer Science, nor by M.S.E. vs Ph.D. within CS. Because no working, explicitly dated (2024-2025 / Fall 2024) source with CS-specific enrollment counts was accessible, all counts are set to 0."
