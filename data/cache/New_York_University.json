    "notes": "Searched for NYU Computer Science (Courant/CAS) and NYU Tandon CSE enrollment counts explicitly labeled with 2024+ (e.g., \u201cFall 2024\u201d, \u201c2024-2025\u201d, \u201cAY 2024-25\u201d). Checked NYU CS site pages (Undergraduates overview/major pages; Masters overview/MSCS pages; PhD overview pages) and NYU Tandon CSE department pages; none report headcount/enrollment totals for CS majors/MS/PhD with an explicit Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 label (they provide program descriptions/requirements, calendars, resources, etc., but no enrollment numbers). Found NYU Tandon \u2018Fast Facts\u2019 with overall Tandon enrollment explicitly for Fall 2024 (https://engineering.nyu.edu/about/fast-facts) but it is school-wide (not CS-specific), so rejected. Found NYU Bulletins \u2018Enrollment and Graduation Statistics\u2019 (https://bulletins.nyu.edu/nyu/enrollment-graduation-statistics/) but it explicitly reports enrollment as of Fall 2022, so rejected per requirement. Found references online to an NYU Common Data Set 2024-2025 PDF, but (a) CDS typically does not provide CS-program enrollment headcounts, and (b) the official PDF link could not be fetched/verified in this session due to an access error, so it was not usable as a working, verifiable source for CS enrollment counts."

(2) NYU Greene-H100 (TOP500 'Greene-H100'): cores=9,360; assuming 48 CPU-cores per node => 9,360/48=195 nodes; Lenovo SD665-N V3 uses HGX H100 4-GPU SXM5 per node => 195*4=780 H100 SXM (ASSUMPTION: TOP500 entry does not publish GPU count; this derives node count from CPU cores and assumes every node is a 4xH100 SXM5 node). (3) NYU Greene (general HPC): RTX8000 total=292 (implies ~73 nodes * 4 GPUs/node = 292); V100 total=76 (node count listed as 20, but GPUs/node not stated; total used directly). (4) Hudson (now part of Greene): 20 nodes * 8 MI50/node = 160 (AMD; recorded under other_high_vram_gpus). (5) HSRN Kubernetes: 14 NVIDIA GPUs total (model unspecified). (6) NYU Langone Radiology Condo: 10 nodes * 4 A100/node = 40 (A100 memory size not stated; counted as A100 40GB by age/typical config assumption). (7) NYU Langone Skynet: 192 V100 total. (8) NYU Langone BigPurple: 87 GPU nodes with 376 GPUs total; GPU split between V100/A100 not stated, so ALL 376 counted as V100 (older=V100 assumption, cluster went live July 2018). Totals: H100_SXM=780; H200=232; L40S=272; A100_40GB=40; V100=76+192+376=644."
