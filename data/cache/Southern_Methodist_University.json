In the Lyle School of Engineering > Computer Science section (Page 10 of 18), Fall 2024 declared majors are: Computer Science - BA (97) and Computer Science - BS (133), totaling 230 undergraduate CS majors (used for undergrad_cs_count). Graduate CS counts are: Computer Science - MS (227) (used for grad_cs_count) and Computer Science - PhD (43) (used for phd_cs_count). The row \"Computer Science - MS - Online\" is present but has a blank/zero value for Fall 2024. Additional context (not included in undergrad_cs_count): Computer Science - PMJ (pre-major) = 148; Computer Science minor (MN) = 42."
