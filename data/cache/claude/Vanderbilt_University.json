Based on typical university distributions (approximately 80-85% undergrad, 15-20% grad) and the 700 total enrollment: estimated 567 undergrads and 133 graduate students. PhD counts could not be separated from MS counts in available sources. DataUSA shows 282 total CS degrees awarded in 2023 (205 to men, 77 to women), which aligns with the enrollment estimates.
