Graduate CS count estimated from 7 master's degrees in 2022 \u00d7 1.5 year program = 10.5, rounded to 11. However, since the Russ College has 374 graduate students total and multiple departments, estimated 30 MS CS students. PhD estimated at 15 based on the overall PhD student-faculty ratio of 0.8:1 with 63 faculty across all engineering departments, assuming CS has approximately 15-20 faculty."
