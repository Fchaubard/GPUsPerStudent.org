The university's Computing and Technology Services (CTS) website did not mention any GPU computing resources. This may indicate Duquesne does not have a centralized GPU cluster for research computing. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

  "analysis_notes": "Duquesne University is a mid-sized private Catholic university in Pittsburgh with strong CS programs (BA, BS, BS/MS combined, and MS degrees offered). However, no public information about GPU computing resources was found through extensive searches. The university appears to focus more on undergraduate and master's level education in CS rather than research computing infrastructure. CS enrollment numbers had to be estimated based on overall university enrollment since department-specific data was not publicly available."
