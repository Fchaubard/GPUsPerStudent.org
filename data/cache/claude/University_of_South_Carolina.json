The College of Engineering and Computing has more than 3300 students total, with CS typically comprising 15-20% of engineering enrollment at comparable institutions.

Split estimated as 20 H100 + 20 A100 since described as 'A100/H100' mixed cluster.\n\n2) AI Institute cluster: 8xA100 GPU cluster mentioned separately = 8 A100 GPUs.\n\n3) Hyperion (flagship cluster): 53 GPU nodes total. Based on 2017 announcement of 'powerful GPU nodes' and 2023 Phase III CPU-only expansion, these are likely older generation GPUs (V100/P100 era).\n\nTOTAL CALCULATIONS:\n- H100: 20 (from Theia mixed nodes)\n- A100 80GB: 20 (Theia) + 8 (AI Institute) + 20 (est. newer Hyperion nodes) = 48\n- V100: 80 (est. from portion of Hyperion's 53 GPU nodes)\n- P100: 40 (est. from older Hyperion GPU nodes)\n- Other: 8 (IBM Power8 quad GPU servers)\n\nNote: Exact GPU counts per node and model distribution for Hyperion's 53 GPU nodes not specified in sources, so estimates based on typical configurations and cluster age."
