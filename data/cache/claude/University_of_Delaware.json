The only specifically identified GPUs are 96 Tesla S2070s from 2011. While Caviness (49 GPUs) and DARWIN (22 GPUs) clusters exist, their GPU models are not publicly documented. Student counts are based on degrees awarded data, with undergraduate enrollment estimated using standard program duration assumptions."
