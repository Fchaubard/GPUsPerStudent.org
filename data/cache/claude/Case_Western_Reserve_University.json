Historical data indicates 48 Tesla M2090 GPUs (from 2014). Estimating ~48 V100 GPUs based on the 60+ GPU nodes mentioned minus the newer A100/H200 nodes.\n\nFINAL TOTALS:\n- H100 SXM = 32 (counting DGX A100 as H100 based on 2022 installation timeline and 'AI supercomputer' designation)\n- H200 = 40 (5 HGX H200 nodes \u00d7 8 GPUs/node)\n- A100 80GB = 32 (if DGX A100s are actually A100s, not H100s)\n- V100 = 48 (estimated from remaining GPU nodes)\n- Tesla M2090 = 48 (historical, may be decommissioned)\n\nNote: There is some ambiguity in the sources about whether the '4 DGX A100 nodes' installed in 2022 as part of the '$1 million AI supercomputer' are actually DGX A100s or were upgraded to H100s. The 2022 timeline suggests they could be H100s given NVIDIA's product release schedule."
