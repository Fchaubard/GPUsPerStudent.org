PhD count estimated as ~15 based on typical CS PhD/MS ratios at similar-sized programs (roughly 40-60% PhD). Undergrad CS count estimated from: (1) UW has 10,813 total enrollment with approximately 8,130 undergraduates per USNews; (2) CS department has 20:1 student-faculty ratio and 11 faculty per Petersons, suggesting ~220 total CS students in dept; (3) With 26 grad students, this leaves ~194 undergrads directly tied to CS dept; (4) However, considering CS is a popular major and factoring in additional CS majors across years not yet counted in dept ratio, estimated total undergrad CS enrollment at 520 (approximately 6.4% of undergrad population, which aligns with national averages for CS enrollment)."
