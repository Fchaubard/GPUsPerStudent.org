  "analysis_notes": "George Mason University operates two main HPC clusters: Hopper (primary) and ARGO (legacy). The CS department has experienced significant growth, with undergraduate enrollment quadrupling from 550 in 2012 to over 2,200 students. The university has been investing in GPU infrastructure, including recent additions of A100 80GB nodes and one H100 node. The H100 node represents George Mason's entry into the latest generation of NVIDIA GPUs. A significant portion of the A100 GPUs are configured with MIG technology to maximize utilization for diverse workloads."
