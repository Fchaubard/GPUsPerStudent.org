Graduate and PhD counts estimated based on typical program sizes relative to CS departments of similar size. Total enrollment figures from Wikipedia (8,247 total, 6,371 undergrad, 1,876 graduate) confirm the school has substantial graduate programs. CS represents about 14% of bachelor's degrees awarded."
