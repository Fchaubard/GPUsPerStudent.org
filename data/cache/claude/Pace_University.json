Using standard program lengths (4 years undergrad, 2 years MS, 5 years PhD), estimated undergraduate CS enrollment = 169 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 0.77 = 520 (adjusting for Seidenberg having multiple programs). Graduate CS estimated from 74 MS degrees in 2021-2022 \u00d7 2 years \u00d7 2.8 growth factor = 420. PhD estimated based on typical doctoral program size."
