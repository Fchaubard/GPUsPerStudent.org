With a typical 4-year program, estimated undergraduate CS enrollment is approximately 11 \u00d7 5 years = 55 students. No graduate CS programs found. The university offers BS degrees in both Computer Science and Computer Information Systems, but does not appear to have MS or PhD programs in computer science.

While they mention having a 'high-performance computing cluster', no specifications are provided. Student enrollment data shows approximately 55 undergraduate CS students based on degree completion rates, with no evidence of graduate CS programs. The lack of detailed GPU information suggests either a small cluster or restricted access to infrastructure details."
