Graduate MS count estimated from: 2020 news article showed 89 Master's students graduated; assuming typical 1.5-2 year MS program duration, estimated enrollment = 89 \u00d7 1.7 \u2248 150. PhD count estimated from: 2020 article showed 8 PhDs graduated; assuming typical 5.5-year program gives estimated enrollment = 8 \u00d7 5.5 = 44. The 36.8% women figure from BPC plan provides additional validation of significant CS enrollment."

The CS department's Hydra cluster is mentioned as having GPU servers purchased in 2016-2023 but without model specifications. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
