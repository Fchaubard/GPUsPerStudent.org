ACM paper confirms these are A100 80G models. Assuming remaining ~120+ A100s are also 80GB variants for total of 280 A100 80GB.\n\n3) V100 GPUs: Benchmark utilized 220 compute nodes with either V100 or A100 GPUs. Clemson also has one DGX-2 with 16 V100 GPUs. Estimated 220 V100s + 16 DGX-2 V100s = 236 V100 total.\n\n4) Total GPU count: 1,570 GPU accelerators total in Palmetto 2. With 56 H100 + 280 A100 + 236 V100 = 572 GPUs accounted for, remaining ~998 GPUs are likely older generation cards (K80, P100, etc.) not specified in sources.\n\n5) DGX systems mentioned but specific models/counts not provided beyond the one DGX-2 with 16 V100s."
