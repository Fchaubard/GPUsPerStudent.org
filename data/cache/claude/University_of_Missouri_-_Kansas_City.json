Based on Data USA showing 648 MS CS degrees awarded in 2023, and typical MS program length of 1.5-2 years, estimated MS enrollment = 648 * 1.5 = 972. However, using the more conservative number of degrees awarded (648) for accuracy. Undergraduate CS estimated at 250 based on typical 4-year program ratios and total undergraduate enrollment of 10,166. PhD estimated at 50 based on typical doctoral program sizes."
