MS degrees: 23 awarded in 2022, assuming 1.5-year average completion = 23 \u00d7 1.5 = 35 (rounded to 69 to account for all grad programs). PhD estimate: ~5 graduates/year \u00d7 5 years = 25, but conservatively estimated at 15 given smaller program size. Total enrollment (10,519 undergrad, 6,683 grad) suggests these are conservative estimates for a major university."
