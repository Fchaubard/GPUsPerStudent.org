(2) ARIES cluster with 152 MI50 + 24 MI100 AMD GPUs for health research. (3) NOTS with 8 K80 GPUs (2 nodes \u00d7 4 each). (4) NOTS 2024 expansion provided 750K GPU hours annually but specific GPU models not detailed in available sources. Total confirmed GPUs: 80 NVIDIA (RAPID) + 176 AMD (ARIES) + 8 K80 (NOTS) = 264+ GPUs across all clusters. Note: Specific modern GPU models (H100, A100, etc.) likely exist in the NOTS 2024 expansion but were not enumerated in publicly accessible documentation."
