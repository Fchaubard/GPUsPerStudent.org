Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering offers undergrad CS program. Estimate based on typical engineering school enrollment patterns (3-4% of undergrads in CS = ~200 students, with ~50 per year graduating). Graduate CS enrollment estimated from MS programs in Applied AI, Applied Data Science, and Cybersecurity Engineering offered. No PhD program in CS found at USD. December 2024 senior ceremony for engineering and CS graduates confirms active program. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
