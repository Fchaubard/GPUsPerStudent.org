  "analysis_notes": "Data collected December 15, 2025. SMU operates three main HPC systems: the AI-focused DGX SuperPOD (20 nodes with 160 A100 GPUs), the newer M3 cluster, and the older ManeFrame II (M2) cluster. CS enrollment data estimated from degree awards - 90 bachelor's degrees awarded in 2021-2022 indicates approximately 360 undergraduates (4-year program). Graduate numbers estimated from 22 CS master's degrees and broader computer & information sciences data."
