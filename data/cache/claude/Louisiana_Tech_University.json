With COES being 22.9% of total enrollment and CS being a major program within COES, estimated CS represents ~16% of COES enrollment = 496 total CS students. Split estimated as 75% undergrad (372), 18.75% MS (93), 6.25% PhD (31) based on typical university distributions. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
