Estimates based on: 1) Howard's total enrollment of 13,416 (10,190 undergrad, 3,226 grad) and 2) Howard being ranked #1 HBCU for undergraduate CS programs. Typical CS program sizes at comparable universities range from 3-5% of total enrollment. Conservative estimate of 4% for undergrad (400), with typical MS/PhD distribution of 100 MS and 30 PhD students."
