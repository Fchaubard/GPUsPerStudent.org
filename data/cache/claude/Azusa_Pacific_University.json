The CEMPS department covers 5 disciplines (CS, Engineering, Math, Physics, Statistics). With small class sizes mentioned and assuming roughly equal distribution across CEMPS programs, estimated ~550 CEMPS undergrads total, with CS being approximately 20-25% of CEMPS enrollment = ~120 undergrad CS majors. Graduate estimate based on proportion of total grad enrollment (3,510) and limited CS graduate programs. PhD count marked as -1 (not found) as APU does not appear to offer PhD programs in Computer Science."
