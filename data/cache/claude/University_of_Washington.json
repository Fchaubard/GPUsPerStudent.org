Specific models available include H100 (available as 2x H100 node configurations), L40, H50, and Tesla P100. Tillicum cluster has H200 GPUs but exact count not specified. The H100 count of 16 represents minimum confirmed (8 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs based on available purchase configurations). Actual counts across all UW systems are likely significantly higher but not publicly documented with specificity."

GPU infrastructure at UW consists of multiple systems: (1) Hyak Klone cluster with 448+ GPUs including H100, L40, H50, and legacy models; (2) New Tillicum cluster with H200 GPUs; (3) Research Computing Club provides GPU access to students. Total GPU counts are underestimated as specific model breakdowns were not publicly available for the full 448+ GPU inventory."
