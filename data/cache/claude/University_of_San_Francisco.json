Based on total enrollment of 5,729 undergrads and 3,483 graduate students, with USF being a liberal arts university with many programs, CS is estimated to represent approximately 2.6% of undergrads (150) and 3.4% of graduate students (120). USF offers MS in Computer Science but does not appear to have a PhD program in CS based on search results."
