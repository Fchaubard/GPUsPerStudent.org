Estimated based on: 1) Clark has 2,369 total undergrads and 1,755 graduate students (2023-24); 2) Clark offers CS major/minor plus data science programs; 3) Typical liberal arts CS programs are 2-5% of undergrads. Estimated 60 undergrad CS majors (~2.5% of 2,369), 35 MS students, and 10 PhD students based on department size of 8 faculty members and 10:1 student-faculty ratio."
