Northwestern CS offers BS/BA degrees through both McCormick School of Engineering and Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. The department has significantly expanded in recent years with new faculty hires and facilities. Graduate programs include MS in CS, MS in AI, MS in IT, and several interdisciplinary PhD programs (CS+LS, TSB). Based on typical Northwestern engineering department sizes and the fact that CS is one of the most popular majors at Northwestern. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
