With YWCC awarding 271 MS in Computer & Information Sciences degrees in 2023 (per DataUSA), and assuming average 2-year MS program duration, estimated MS CS enrollment ~542. PhD count estimated from remaining graduate students (1,503 - 542 = ~961) distributed across multiple programs; conservatively estimating ~303 PhD CS students based on typical program distributions and 5-6 year PhD duration."
