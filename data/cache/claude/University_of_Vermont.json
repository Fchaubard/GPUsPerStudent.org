Undergraduate CS enrollment estimated based on UVM having 12,276 total undergraduates in Fall 2024 (US News) and CS being a major department in CEMS. The College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences typically has 15-20% of total undergraduate enrollment, and CS represents approximately 20-25% of CEMS students, suggesting ~600 CS undergraduates.

Total current GPUs: 16 H100 + 8 A100 + 80 V100 = 104 GPUs. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
