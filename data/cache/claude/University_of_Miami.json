Based on program offerings (BS, BA, BS+MS, MS, PhD programs) and university total enrollment of 19,593 (12,883 undergraduate, 6,710 graduate), CS enrollment estimated using typical CS department ratios: ~6% of undergrads (800), ~3% of grad students excluding PhD (200), and ~50 PhD students based on typical research university CS PhD cohort sizes. The department offers comprehensive programs and has active research areas, supporting these enrollment estimates. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
