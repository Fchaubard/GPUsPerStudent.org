Collegefactual.com reported 67 bachelor's degrees in computer & information sciences awarded in 2022. Assuming a 4-year program with steady state enrollment, estimated undergraduate CS count = 67 \u00d7 3 years remaining \u2248 200. For MS students, collegefactual reported 30 MS degrees in 2021-2022, and with typical 2-year programs, estimated MS enrollment = 30 \u00d7 3 semesters \u00f7 2 \u2248 45. However, Marquette also has MS in Data Science and MS in Computer & Information Science programs; estimating combined MS enrollment at 90 students. PhD program typically takes 4-5 years, with approximately 1 PhD awarded in 2022 (per collegefactual), estimating 30 PhD students total based on department size and faculty count (54 full-time faculty per US News)."
