Specific GPU models and counts are not publicly available.\n\n4) CAC (Center for Advanced Computing): Hosts private HPC and GPU clusters for various departments including CS, but specific GPU inventory is not publicly disclosed.\n\nNOTE: Cornell appears to operate a highly distributed computing model where individual research groups and departments own their GPU resources rather than having a centralized university-wide GPU cluster. The actual total GPU count is likely much higher than what is publicly documented, as many department and research group clusters are not publicly enumerated."
