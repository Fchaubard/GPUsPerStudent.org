The CS department offers BA/BS in CS, BS in Computer Engineering, BS in CS & Math, BS in CS & Cybersecurity at undergraduate level, and MS in Computer Science at graduate level. Based on typical CS department sizes at similar universities (approximately 4% of undergrads, 3.6% of graduate students), estimated CS enrollment is calculated. PhD count estimated based on faculty size (10 full-time faculty per department website) and typical advisor-student ratios. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
