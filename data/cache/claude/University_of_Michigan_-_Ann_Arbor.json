  "analysis_notes": "Data collection was challenging as specific GPU inventory details for University of Michigan clusters were not readily available in public documentation. The university operates three main HPC clusters (Great Lakes, Armis2, Lighthouse) but detailed hardware specifications are not published. Student enrollment data is from 2017-2018 for CS-specific numbers, as more recent CS-specific enrollment was not found. The university has seen significant growth in CS enrollment, nearly quadrupling since 2010."
