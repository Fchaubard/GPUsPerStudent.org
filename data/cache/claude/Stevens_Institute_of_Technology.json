For graduate MS count, assuming 1.5 year average completion: 728*1.5 = 1092. PhD estimate based on typical program ratios at similar institutions (~5-8% of graduate CS enrollment).

The 31 Quadro K3100M GPUs mentioned are older consumer-grade cards with only 4GB memory."

Historical data shows investment in HPC but current GPU inventory appears limited compared to peer institutions. CS program is substantial with 728 MS degrees awarded in 2023 (most common master's degree at Stevens), suggesting significant computational needs that may not be fully met by on-campus resources."
