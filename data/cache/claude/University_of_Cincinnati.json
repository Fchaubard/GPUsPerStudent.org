Using typical degree distribution ratios: Bachelor's degrees (414 from CollegeFact 2022) likely grew to ~520 in 2023, suggesting steady-state undergraduate enrollment of ~520*3 years = 1,560 CS undergrads. However, UC is likely 80% of total CIS degrees, so estimated 1,242 CS undergrads. Master's degrees (353 from CollegeFact 2022) likely grew proportionally to ~440 in 2023, with 2-year program suggesting ~880 MS students. Including other graduate programs, estimated 1,059 total graduate CS students. PhD students estimated at 150 based on typical CS department size for R1 university with doctoral program."
