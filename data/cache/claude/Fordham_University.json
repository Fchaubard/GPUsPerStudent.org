Estimates based on: Graduate program data showing 94 MS students enrolled (from Peterson's data), small class sizes mentioned across sources, and typical program sizes at similar universities. The CIS department offers BA-CS, BS-CS, BS-ITS degrees at undergraduate level and MS-CS, MS-Cybersecurity, MS-Data Science, and PhD-CS at graduate level. With 10,307 total undergraduates and CS being a popular major, estimated 400 undergrads (3.9% of total). Graduate estimate includes all CIS programs. PhD estimate based on typical small program size and 5-year guaranteed funding mentioned. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

Specific GPU models not disclosed. Based on CUDA core count, estimated 8-10 GPUs total.\n\nThe university does not provide detailed specifications about GPU models, memory configurations, or exact counts. The 64,000 CUDA cores could represent various configurations:\n- ~9x V100 (5,120 cores each) = 46,080 cores\n- ~8x A100 (6,912 cores each) = 55,296 cores\n- ~10x A40 (10,752 cores each) = 107,520 cores\n\nGiven the 56 TFLOPS performance mentioned, this most closely aligns with 8-10 GPUs of the V100/A100 generation. Grace-Hopper (GH200) GPUs are planned but not yet installed.\n\nNote: All specific GPU model counts marked as -1 (not found) as Fordham does not publish detailed hardware specifications."
