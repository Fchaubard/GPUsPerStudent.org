  "analysis_notes": "Princeton has made significant investments in GPU infrastructure, particularly with 336 H100 GPUs dedicated to PLI (Princeton Language and Intelligence) and 152 H200 GPUs for the AI Lab. The CS department maintains its own substantial GPU cluster (Ionic) with diverse GPU models. Total GPU count across all systems exceeds 924 GPUs as stated on main page. Student data derived from degree conferral rates suggests approximately 1,103 total CS students across all programs."
