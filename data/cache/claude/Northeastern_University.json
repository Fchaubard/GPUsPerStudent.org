The BPC plan document indicates 2,299 MS students in a subset of programs, suggesting total graduate enrollment may be higher. Total CS-related degrees awarded across all levels in 2023 was 1,778 per DataUSA."

Specific H200 count confirmed as 32 GPUs.\n\n2) Discovery Cluster (Legacy): Referenced as having 200 GPUs total, likely older generation models being phased out.\n\nTOTAL GPU COUNT: 525 (Explorer) + 200 (Discovery) = 725 GPUs\n\nBREAKDOWN BY MODEL (estimated based on typical HPC distributions and confirmed H200 count):\n- H200: 32 (confirmed)\n- H100 SXM: 70 (estimated portion of Hopper GPUs)\n- A100 80GB: 100 (estimated, common in HPC)\n- A6000: 40 (estimated RTX workstation GPUs)\n- L40S: 40 (estimated Lovelace GPUs)\n- V100: 80 (estimated older generation)\n- P100: 50 (estimated Pascal generation)\n- A5000: 30 (estimated)\n- T4: 53 (estimated Turing GPUs)\n- Remaining ~230 GPUs likely distributed among other models\n\nNote: Exact model-by-model breakdown not publicly available. Estimates based on typical university HPC GPU distributions with newer models (H200/H100) in smaller quantities and older models (V100/P100) in larger quantities."
