Estimate based on: Illinois State has School of Information Technology offering CS degrees; total enrollment is 20,989 (2023); has accredited CS programs per ABET; DataUSA shows strong STEM programs but doesn't break down by major. Conservative estimate of ~3% of undergrads in CS (600 of 18,450) and ~6% of grads (150 of 2,539). ISU does not appear to offer PhD in CS based on searches."
