  "analysis_notes": "University of Florida has made significant GPU infrastructure investments, including the 2025 upgrade to 63 DGX B200 nodes (504 B200 GPUs) replacing their previous 140 DGX A100 SuperPOD. Student enrollment data from multiple sources indicates approximately 1,963 total CS students (undergrad + grad + PhD). The ratio of high-end GPUs to CS students is particularly strong with the new B200 deployment."
