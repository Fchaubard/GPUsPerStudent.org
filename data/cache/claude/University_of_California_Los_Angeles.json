T4 count estimated at 10 GPUs.\n\n3) Social Sciences HPC (SSHPCC): 5 compute nodes with 1x RTX 2080 each + 1 GPU node with 2x A40 = 5 RTX 2080 + 2 A40 total.\n\nNote: Exact GPU counts for Hoffman2 cluster not publicly enumerated. Conservative estimates based on typical university HPC deployments with mentioned GPU types."
