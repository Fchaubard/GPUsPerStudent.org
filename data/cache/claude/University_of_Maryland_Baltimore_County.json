Graduate CS estimated as ~600 MS students based on MS degree completions of 151/year \u00d7 2 year program \u00d7 2 (accounting for part-time students). PhD estimated at 150 based on COEIT PhD total of 335 and CS being ~45% of doctoral programs. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
