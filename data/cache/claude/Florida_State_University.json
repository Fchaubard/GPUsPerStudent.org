Based on typical program ratios and 60 new enrollees annually, estimated 50 PhD students within the 173 total. Undergraduate CS count estimated at 600 based on: FSU total undergrad enrollment 32,720 (Fall 2024), typical CS major enrollment at public research universities (~1.5-2% of undergrads), and CS being among top 50 public CS programs. The 600 estimate represents ~1.8% of total undergrads."
