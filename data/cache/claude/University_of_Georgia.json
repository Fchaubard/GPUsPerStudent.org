The 260 graduate students includes both MS and PhD students. News from fall 2024 enrollment shows computer science PhD program increased by 21 students, suggesting approximately 21 PhD students. MS enrollment estimated as 260 - 21 = 239 students."

From wiki.gacrc.uga.edu: 12 nodes \u00d7 4 H100/node = 48 H100 GPUs; 14 nodes \u00d7 4 A100/node = 56 A100 GPUs (existing). From DataCenterDynamics article about new 2024 investment: additional 2 nodes \u00d7 4 A100/node = 8 A100 GPUs, bringing total A100 to 64. L4 GPUs: 12 nodes \u00d7 4 L4/node = 48 L4 GPUs. Total identified: 48 H100 + 64 A100 + 48 L4 = 160 GPUs. The July 2024 proposal document states 194 total GPUs, leaving 34 unspecified GPUs of various models (likely older generation like V100).
