Assuming PhD ~150 students (5-6 year program \u00d7 25-30 graduates), leaves ~1,682 bachelor degrees. Using 4-year residency gives ~1,400 undergraduate CS majors enrolled. MS count from DataUSA showing 956 MS CS degrees awarded in 2023. PhD count conservatively estimated based on typical CS department size at R1 universities."
