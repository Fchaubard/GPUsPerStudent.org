Estimated ~5% of undergrads in CS (typical for mid-size universities) = 350 students. Graduate programs (MS/PhD) estimated at typical 20-25% of undergraduate size = 125 total, split as 80 MS and 45 PhD based on typical ratios."

GPU resources are modest compared to larger research universities, with only 1 H100, 16 A40s, and various professional visualization GPUs. CS department appears healthy with strong rankings (#16 for tech salaries among publics) and 1/3 female enrollment (well above national average). Data science program growth (most popular minor) indicates strong computing interest on campus."
