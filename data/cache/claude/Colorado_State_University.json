Based on typical Dell HPC configurations from 2016-2017 era, estimated as 2 GPUs per node = 20 GPUs (likely V100 or P100 generation).\n\n2) Alpine cluster (CSU contribution): CSU is a joint funder with CU Boulder and CU Anschutz. Alpine has aa100 (NVIDIA A100) and ami100 (AMD MI100) partitions. CSU's estimated share is approximately 1/3 of GPU resources.\n\n3) Falcon cluster (CS Department): Supports GPU jobs but specific GPU counts not provided in documentation.\n\n4) Keck cluster (Engineering): State-of-art nodes mentioned but specific GPU configuration not detailed.\n\nESTIMATED TOTALS:\n- A100 GPUs: 50 (25 80GB + 25 40GB estimated from CSU's Alpine contribution)\n- L40S: 10 (estimated from CSU's Alpine contribution)\n- V100: 20 (estimated from Summit)\n- P100: 20 (estimated from older Summit nodes)\n- AMD MI100: 15 (estimated from CSU's Alpine contribution) [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
