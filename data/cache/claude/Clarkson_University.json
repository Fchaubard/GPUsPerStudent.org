CS is offered as BS, MS, and PhD programs. As a STEM-focused university with engineering as the largest school, CS likely represents ~6% of undergrads (150), ~11% of grads (120), and given the small research department description, approximately 25 PhD students. These are conservative estimates based on typical CS enrollment at similar technical universities."

Given the NSF funding date (Grant No. 1925596) and typical HPC procurement cycles, these are likely older generation GPUs (possibly V100 or earlier), but without specification details, cannot determine exact models."
