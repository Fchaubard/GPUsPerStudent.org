Computer science is listed as one of the highest enrollment graduate programs at USD. CS is also mentioned as a popular major among entering undergraduate classes. Specific CS student counts are estimated based on: (1) typical CS department size at similar universities (~2-3% of total undergrad enrollment), (2) USD's total undergrad enrollment of 7,619 students (fall 2024), and (3) the reported significant growth trends. Undergraduate CS estimated at ~150 students (2% of undergrad enrollment), Graduate CS estimated at ~120 students based on it being a high-enrollment graduate program. PhD CS count not found in available data."
