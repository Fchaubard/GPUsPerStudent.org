  "analysis_notes": "Yale has substantial GPU resources spread across multiple clusters and facilities. The newest Bouchet cluster at MGHPCC represents significant AI/HPC investment with 80 H200 GPUs. Additional secure computing resources (Hopper) provide 32 more H200s. Student data challenging to find - graduate CS enrollment confirmed at 46 total, with PhD students estimated based on typical program patterns. Undergraduate CS major count not explicitly published but estimated based on CS being a popular major at Yale."
