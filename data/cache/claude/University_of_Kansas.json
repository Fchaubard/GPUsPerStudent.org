Estimates based on: (1) Total university enrollment of 28,406 with 20,696 undergrads and 7,710 grad students; (2) EECS is one of 11 major academic departments using BigJay cluster per NSF grant; (3) 75% of EECS graduate students receive funding support; (4) Typical CS department represents 3-5% of total university enrollment at large research universities. Used conservative 4% estimate for undergrads (800) and higher proportion for graduate programs given EECS research focus."
