Based on typical academic cloud sizing (Red Cloud has ~90 nodes total), estimating ~16 GPU nodes * 2 GPUs = 32.\n   - Total: ~40.\n\nCornell utilizes a 'Cloud' model (Red Cloud) rather than a single large batch scheduler, making exact public inventory counts opaque compared to other universities. Counts here are conservative estimates based on verifiable instance types and cluster descriptions."
