This same page explicitly references \"2024 -2025 CS Catalog Information\" (link on the page), satisfying the 2024+ requirement. The page does not provide separate, explicit 2024/Fall 2024 headcounts for CS M.S. vs CS Ph.D.; after searching RPI Quick Facts (Fall 2024 overall enrollment), Registrar pages, and CS program pages, no official 2024+ CS graduate (MS-only) or PhD-only enrollment counts were found, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."
