    "notes": "Source is Yeshiva University Office of Institutional Research (Official Enrollment Statistics) PDF for Fall 2024. The PDF explicitly states it is for Fall 2024 and is 'as of October 15 2024' (census date). In the 'Graduate and Professional' section, the row '159. Katz- Computer Science' shows 0 enrolled (all columns are 0), so grad_cs_count=0. The report does NOT provide undergraduate enrollment by major/field (it reports undergraduate headcount by school such as Yeshiva College, Stern College, Syms, etc.), so undergrad_cs_count cannot be extracted for CS from this Fall 2024 document and is set to 0. No Computer Science Ph.D. line appears in the Fall 2024 program list (only, e.g., 'Katz Math - PHD'), so phd_cs_count is set to 0. File name includes '03272025', which appears to indicate a later posting/update date, but the enrollment census date shown in the PDF is October 15, 2024."

To fit requested buckets, counted all 8 as A100 40GB (a common academic 8\u00d7A100 configuration). If you prefer a different assumption (e.g., A100 80GB), shift 8 from a100_40gb_count to a100_80gb_count.\n\nItems not counted:\n- Mentioned per-student A4000 workstations are not included in requested GPU categories.\n\nNo other public Yeshiva University GPU cluster specifications (nodes/GPUs) were found in the searched sources beyond the above lab/server mentions."
