Found an official Vanderbilt University Registrar/Office of Data and Strategic Analytics PDF titled as a 2024-2025 Year; 2024 Fall enrollment report (Report Date: 9/18/24), which satisfies the 2024 requirement, but it reports enrollment by SCHOOL and degree-level categories (e.g., School of Engineering totals) and does NOT provide Computer Science major/program headcounts (undergrad CS majors, MS CS only, or PhD CS only). Also attempted to use Vanderbilt DSA 'Student Factbook' (Tableau Public) for major-level data, but only a static image was accessible in this environment and did not provide extractable Fall 2024 CS counts. Vanderbilt's older Factbook site linked from the Registrar page (virg.vanderbilt.edu) returned a server error (502) when accessed. Pre-2023 CS enrollment figures found elsewhere (e.g., Fall 2022) were rejected per requirements."
