    "notes": "Graduate student data from Peterson's shows 22 enrolled (likely PhD students based on acceptance/enrollment ratio). Undergraduate CS enrollment estimated based on typical CS department size at similar research universities with ~20,000 total students. The university has 15,155 undergraduates and 5,669 graduate students total (2024). With a School of Engineering and Computer Science, CS typically represents 3-5% of undergraduate enrollment at peer institutions, suggesting ~450-750 CS undergrads. Used conservative estimate of 450. MS CS students estimated at 150 based on typical MS:PhD ratios at research universities."
