    "notes": "Searched for Pepperdine CS enrollment specifically for AY 2024-2025 / Fall 2024. The Seaver College Academic Catalog is explicitly labeled \u201c2024\u20132025\u201d and includes Fall 2024 dates, and it lists CS-related majors/minors and course requirements, but it does NOT publish student headcount/enrollment by major (no CS enrollment numbers found). Also checked Pepperdine OIE Factbook / Fall Enrollment Census pages and related iframe pages, but the enrollment dashboards do not expose 2024 data in the page text (likely JS/embedded dashboards). Pepperdine\u2019s Common Data Set 2024-2025 link appears to be hosted on Google Drive and was not retrievable in this environment, so major-level counts could not be verified. Per requirement to reject 2023 or earlier data, counts are set to 0."
