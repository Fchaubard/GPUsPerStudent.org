The MIRO Enrollment page lists a 'By College/Department' section with a 'Fall 2024' link, but it explicitly states 'UH Login is required to view the data below as it is classified as sensitive,' and the linked data portal is not publicly viewable. I also checked the UH M\u0101noa Common Data Set 2024-2025 PDF (hosted by MIRO), which includes overall Fall 2024 enrollment totals for the institution, but it does not provide enrollment by major/department (e.g., Computer Science) nor an MS-vs-PhD split for CS. Because no acceptable 2024+ CS enrollment counts were available in public sources, all requested counts are set to 0."

Quantities by GPU model are not published in the accessible public pages; only the available GPU *types* (gres values) are listed.\n- For this response, I used the Confluence total (147 GPUs) as the binding total and estimated a plausible mix consistent with the documented available GPU types.\n- Estimated Koa breakdown (sums to 147):\n  * H200: 1 node \u00d7 8 = 8\n  * H100 PCIe-class (treating nvidia_h100_pcie / nvidia_h100_nvl / NV-H100 as PCIe/NVL because SXM is not stated): 2 nodes \u00d7 8 = 16\n  * L40 (not L40S): 2 nodes \u00d7 4 = 8\n  * V100 SXM2: 8 nodes \u00d7 8 = 64\n  * A30: 8 nodes \u00d7 4 = 32\n  * Quadro RTX 5000: 4 nodes \u00d7 2 = 8\n  * RTX A4000: 4 nodes \u00d7 2 = 8\n  * RTX 2080 Ti: 1 node \u00d7 2 = 2\n  * RTX 2070: 1 node \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n2) Jetstream 2 (UH host site mentioned on UH EPSCoR facilities page; accelerator nodes)\n- 2 accelerator nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs/node = 8 A100 GPUs.\n- A100 memory variant (40GB vs 80GB) is not stated; I counted these as A100 40GB by default (assumption).\n\nTOTALS ACROSS ALL CLUSTERS (Koa + Jetstream2)\n- H200: 8\n- H100 PCIe-class: 16\n- H100 SXM: 0 (not evidenced)\n- A100: 8 (assumed 40GB)\n- V100: 64\n- Others are listed in other_high_vram_gpus with estimated counts.\n\nIf you want a non-estimated breakdown by exact GPU model and quantity, the missing piece is a public table/output mapping GRES types to node lists and per-node GPU counts (e.g., a published `sinfo -N -o '%N %G'` output or an inventory table)."
