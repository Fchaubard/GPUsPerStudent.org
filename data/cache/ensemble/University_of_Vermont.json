Found UVM OIRA Common Data Set 2024-2025 (PDF dated 2024-2025; institutional enrollment as of Oct 15, 2024) but it reports only institution-wide totals (e.g., total undergraduates/graduate students) and does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/program (no CS-specific headcount). UVM OIRA 'Undergraduate Enrollment' and 'Graduate and Medical/Professional Students' Factbook pages list an 'Enrollment by Program' dashboard, but it is restricted to UVM affiliates (login required), so no public CS enrollment headcount for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 was available. Per the requirement to reject 2023-or-earlier data, counts are set to 0."
