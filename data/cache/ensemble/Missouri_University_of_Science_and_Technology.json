Found multiple Fall 2024 overall-enrollment sources, but no CS-major headcount breakdown for 2024+.\n\nWhat I checked (and why it was rejected/insufficient):\n- Missouri S&T CS department pages (e.g., cs.mst.edu) did not provide a Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 CS student headcount.\n- Missouri S&T IR/DM 'Student Data' page links to an official UM System 'Fall Enrollment (Excel)' file (XLSX) that likely contains the needed breakdown, but the dataset is only available as an XLSX download and I could not retrieve/view its contents in a way that allowed verifying 2024+ CS-major counts.\n- 'ABET Programs UG Fall Enrollment' PDF available from the same Student Data page includes 'ComputerScienceBS' but only reports through Fall 2023 (explicitly not acceptable per your rules).\n- UM System IPEDS EF 'Fall Enrollment 2024-25' PDF for MST exists and is explicitly 2024-25, but it only reports enrollment for a required subset of broad CIP fields (e.g., Engineering, Mathematics, etc.) and does not include Computer Science, so it cannot be used to produce CS enrollment counts.\n\nResult: No verifiable 2024-2025 / Fall 2024 Missouri S&T CS enrollment counts (UG / MS-only / PhD-only) were located in accessible sources; counts returned as 0 per your instructions."
