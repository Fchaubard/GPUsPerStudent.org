(2) 'Computer Science - Completer (CPSC)' shows 122 undergrad male + 49 undergrad female = 171 total undergrad. Undergrad CS total reported here = 375 + 171 = 546. The same Fall 2024 table lists 'Computer Sci & Software Engr (COMP)' with graduate male 156 + graduate female 42 = 198 total graduate, but it does NOT break graduate enrollment into Master's vs PhD; therefore grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0 per your requirement (MS-only and PhD-only counts)."
