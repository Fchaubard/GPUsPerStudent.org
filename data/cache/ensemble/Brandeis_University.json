    "notes": "Searched for Brandeis Computer Science (COSI/Michtom School of Computer Science) student enrollment counts specifically dated 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 (e.g., 'Computer Science majors as of Fall 2024', MS CS headcount Fall 2024, CS PhD headcount Fall 2024) using the requested queries and additional targeted searches. Found an official Brandeis 'Schools and Enrollment' Fast Facts page explicitly labeled 'Enrollments, by school (fall 2024)' with institution-level counts (e.g., School of Arts and Sciences (Undergraduate) 3,632; GSAS 657; etc.), but it does not provide Computer Science program/major-level headcounts. Also found Registrar Schedule/Enrollment Statistics pages explicitly labeled Fall 2024, but those report course-section enrollments (registrations) rather than student headcount in the CS major/program. Found Michtom School of Computer Science pages listing 'Current COSI Master's Students' and 'Current PhD Students', but those pages do not explicitly state 'Fall 2024' or 'AY 2024-25' (so per your rules they were rejected). Therefore no acceptable 2024+ CS-specific student enrollment headcount source was located; all CS counts are set to 0."
