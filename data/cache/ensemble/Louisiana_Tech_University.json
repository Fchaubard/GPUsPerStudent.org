The linked official Louisiana Tech news post (Oct 30, 2024) confirms Fall 2024 quarter COES enrollment and mentions CS growth percentage, but does NOT provide an actual Fall 2024 CS headcount or MS/PhD CS headcounts. Because no source with explicit Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 CS enrollment numbers (undergrad, MS-only, PhD-only) was found, all counts are set to 0."
