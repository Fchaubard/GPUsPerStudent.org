The table row 'Computer Science' shows Total = 611 (Freshman 106 + Sophomore 150 + Junior 155 + Senior 200). I could not locate an official KU source that explicitly provides Fall 2024 (or AY 2024-25) Computer Science graduate enrollment split into Masters vs PhD; Engineering Career Center's 'Graduate enrollment by major and level' page only lists Fall 2019, and KU AIRE/Graduate Program Profiles are Tableau-based without a directly accessible Fall 2024 CS (Masters vs Doctoral) headcount table on the crawled pages. Per requirements, grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."
