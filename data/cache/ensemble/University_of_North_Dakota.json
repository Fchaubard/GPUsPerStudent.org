Undergrad CS count computed by summing CS major plan rows shown under 'Computer Science - College of Engineering & Mines': BA-CSCI total=1, BSCSCI-CS2 totals=26(F)+49(M)=75, BSCSCI-CSC totals=23(F)+118(M)=141; plus CS second-major row ND-MJCSCI total=1 (ND-MJxx indicates 2nd major per report legend). Total undergrad CS = 1+75+141+1 = 218. Masters CS count computed from 'Computer Science' (CSCI) plan rows: MS-CSCI totals=2(F)+11(M)=13, plus MS-CSCI2 total=6(M) => 19. No Computer Science PhD academic plan appears in this Fall 2024 enrollment report section, so phd_cs_count set to 0."
