It lists: 'Undergraduate Enrollment (Fall 2024) \u2013 809' and 'Graduate Enrollment (Fall 2024) - 248'. The page also states: 'Fall 2024 enrollment data was captured based on census count on January 25, 2025.' This source does NOT break the 248 graduate students into master's vs Ph.D., so grad_cs_count (masters-only) and phd_cs_count are set to 0 to avoid misclassification.

GH200 assumption: 36 Grace Hopper 'nodes' counted as 36 GH200-class GPUs (1 per node) because the announcement does not specify GPUs-per-node."
