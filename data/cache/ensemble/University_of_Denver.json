    "notes": "Searched for University of Denver Computer Science enrollment data specifically for AY 2024-2025 / Fall 2024 (rejecting 2023 and earlier per instructions). Found an official University of Denver Common Data Set explicitly labeled 2024-2025 (PDF file path includes 2025-02), but it does not provide Computer Science student headcount/enrollment by program/major (UG vs MS vs PhD). The CDS includes overall institutional enrollment tables and a 'Degrees Conferred' section with broad CIP discipline categories (e.g., 'Computer and information sciences 11') as percentages of degrees awarded, not enrolled student counts. Also attempted to use DU Institutional Research 'Factbook' enrollment pages, but the enrollment content is embedded (iframe) and no publicly accessible, non-interactive table/PDF/CSV with Fall 2024 Computer Science enrollment counts (UG/MS/PhD) was discoverable via the public pages during this search. Therefore, no acceptable 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 CS enrollment headcount source was found, and counts are set to 0 as required."
