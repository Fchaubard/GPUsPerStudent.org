    "notes": "FOUND 2024-25 SOURCE but could not extract CS enrollment counts. The University of La Verne Office of Institutional Research publishes a 'Current Fact Book 2024-25' page that explicitly states it was 'Published April 2025' and links to a Power BI report titled 'Headcounts by Colleges and Program Majors' (this is the most relevant place to find Computer Science headcounts for AY 2024-25 / census dates). However, the major-level headcount data is only available inside embedded Power BI (app.powerbi.com) and was not accessible for automated extraction (no visible table text / no downloadable PDF/CSV found from the public pages). Because no 2024-25 (or Fall 2024) Computer Science headcount number could be directly read/verified from an accessible page, counts are set to 0. Relevant page with explicit year and report links: https://laverne.edu/institutional-research/current-fact-book/ ; the specific (inaccessible-to-extract) majors headcount report link is reached from that page via 'Headcounts by Colleges and Program Majors'."

The only concrete GPU-cluster specs encountered were for San Diego State University\u2019s cluster named 'VERNE' (8 GPU nodes \u00d7 4\u00d7 A100 80GB = 32 GPUs), which is unrelated to University of La Verne and therefore excluded. With no ULV clusters found, all GPU totals are 0 and no nodes\u00d7GPUs_per_node calculations apply."
