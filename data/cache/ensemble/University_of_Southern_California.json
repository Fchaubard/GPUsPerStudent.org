    "notes": "Clusters included: (1) CARC Discovery (USC), (2) Laguna (SoCal Research Computing & Data Alliance cluster managed by USC). Endeavour condo cluster exists but public pages do not provide a GPU inventory suitable for node\u00d7GPU counts, so it is not summed here.\n\nCARC Discovery (uses 'over 180 NVIDIA GPUs available' as total; treated as 180 for arithmetic):\n- A100 nodes from Oct 20, 2021 news: 12 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 24 A100 GPUs.\n- A100 nodes from Nov 22, 2022 news: 12 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 24 A100 GPUs.\n  => Discovery A100 total = 48 GPUs. A100 40GB vs 80GB not specified in the node-add announcements; Discovery docs indicate both exist, so estimated split: 24\u00d7A100-80GB + 24\u00d7A100-40GB.\n- A40 nodes from Oct 20, 2021 news: 12 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 24 A40 GPUs.\n- A40 nodes from Nov 22, 2022 news: 18 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 36 A40 GPUs.\n  => Discovery A40 total = 60 GPUs (reported under other_high_vram_gpus per requested schema).\n- Remaining GPUs on Discovery after known A100 + A40: 180 - 48 - 60 = 72 GPUs.\n  Discovery docs show remaining models include L40S/V100/P100 but do not publish counts, so estimated allocation (to match 72):\n  * L40S: 8 nodes \u00d7 3 GPUs/node = 24 L40S GPUs\n  * V100: 12 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 24 V100 GPUs\n  * P100: 12 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 24 P100 GPUs\n\nLaguna cluster (managed by USC; configuration in event listing):\n- L40S: 8 GPU nodes \u00d7 2 L40S/node = 16 L40S GPUs.\n\nGrand totals (Discovery + Laguna):\n- L40S = 24 + 16 = 40\n- A100-80GB = 24 (est)\n- A100-40GB = 24 (est)\n- V100 = 24 (est)\n- P100 = 24 (est)\n- A40 = 60 (exact from node-add announcements; placed in other_high_vram_gpus)\n- No public evidence found in sources above for USC CARC-operated H100/H200/B100/B200/GH200 inventories; set to 0."
