UH publishes Fall 2024 overall enrollment (e.g., 'UH Facts: Fall 2024' PDF) and NSM college-level Fall 2024 enrollment totals, but neither source provides Computer Science-only headcount. UH Institutional Research 'Statistical Handbook' indicates it can be filtered by major and academic level, but the publicly accessible page is an interactive dashboard and does not expose the underlying Fall 2024 CS counts in a verifiable text/table format via the retrieved page content, so no compliant 2024+ CS headcount numbers could be validated."
