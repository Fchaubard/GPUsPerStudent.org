    "notes": "Searched for UW Computer Science student enrollment (majors/program headcount) specifically for AY 2024-2025 / Fall 2024, per requirements. Found UW Seattle Common Data Set 2024-2025 (PDF) which explicitly references the official fall reporting date 'as of October 15, 2024' and includes institution-wide enrollment tables (Section B: Enrollment and Persistence), but it does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/department (e.g., Computer Science majors, MS-only, PhD-only). Also found Allen School 'Who We Are' page with approximate counts (e.g., undergrad/grad totals), but it does not explicitly state '2024', 'Fall 2024', or '2024-2025', so it was rejected under the absolute date requirement. Attempted to use UW 'Public Profiles \u2013 Headcount Enrollment Trends' as the official factbook-style source, but the public page did not expose usable enrollment-by-major data in the retrieved content (appears to rely on embedded interactive dashboards not accessible via this retrieval). Therefore, no acceptable 2024+ CS-specific enrollment-by-level numbers were found; counts set to 0."
