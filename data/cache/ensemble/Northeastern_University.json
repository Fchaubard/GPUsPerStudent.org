For 'Khoury College of Computer Sciences' (CS college): Undergraduate Total = 3,775 (2,867 full-time + 908 on co-op; part-time = 0). Graduate Total = 4,246 (3,725 grad full-time + 376 on co-op + 145 grad part-time; co-op part-time = 0). The page does NOT break Khoury graduate enrollment into master's vs PhD, so grad_cs_count (MS-only) and phd_cs_count (PhD-only) are set to 0 per requirements. Note: page states 'Fall 2024' and also notes UG/GR fall enrollment excludes non-degree seeking students."
