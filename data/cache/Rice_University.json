I also located Rice/IDEAS \u2018Enrollment by Major/Program\u2019 Tableau reports (trend/snapshot) intended to show enrollment by major/program, but I was unable to access a version that explicitly displays Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 CS headcount values in a directly retrievable text/table form during this run. Per your rules (no 2023-or-earlier fallback), all CS counts are set to 0."
