Undergrad CS count is the sum of Course 6-3 (Computer Science & Engineering: 655), Course 6-4 (AI & Decision Making: 353), Course 6-9 (Computation & Cognition: 112), and Course 6-14 (CS, Econ, Data Science: 96). Does not include Course 6-1 (Electrical Engineering) or 6-2 (EECS General). Grad count is the TOTAL for Course 6 (EECS) as MIT does not separate EE and CS graduate enrollment statistics in public registrar reports; this figure includes Master's (SM/MEng) and PhD students. PhD count is an estimate based on the EECS 'By the Numbers' page which typically indicates ~50% of the grad population is doctoral. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

Satori: 64 nodes \u00d7 4 V100 = 256 V100s.\nTotal V100 = 704.\n\nNote: MIT has several 'condo' clusters (e.g., Engaging, Open Mind at McGovern Institute) and departmental labs (CSAIL Improbable AI) that likely contain A100s/H100s, but their specific node counts and hardware inventories are not listed on public-facing webpages without login/access restrictions. Therefore, H100/A100 counts are set to 0 based on strict auditability rules. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
