Assuming 4-year enrollment: 124 * 4 = 496. Graduate count estimated from NCES IPEDS data (2023) showing 188 CS Master's degrees + 59 Data Science Master's degrees awarded annually. Assuming 1.5-year average program duration: (188 + 59) * 1.5 = 370. University of the Pacific does not list a standalone Computer Science PhD program in its graduate catalog.
