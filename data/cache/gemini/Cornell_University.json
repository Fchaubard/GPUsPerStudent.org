Red Cloud specs list 'g6' nodes with 4x H100. Assuming minimum deployment of 4 nodes (typical for initial academic clouds) = 16 GPUs. (Listed as PCIe as Red Cloud is virtualization-focused, though SXM is possible).\n2) A100: June 2023 News explicitly states '16 new NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs'.\n3) T4: Feb 2022 News explicitly states '64 NVIDIA T4 GPUs'.\n4) V100: Older Red Cloud instances (g3) use V100s. Previous 2019 reports cited 8 nodes x 2 GPUs = 16 V100s (conservative estimate maintained).\n\nNote: Cornell CS Department likely owns private clusters (e.g., 'Kilian Weinberger Lab'), but specs are not public/auditable. Data reflects shared CAC resources. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
