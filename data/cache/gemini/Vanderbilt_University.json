While the 'AI Compute Core' (Jan 2024) announces H100 availability, no specific node count (e.g., '1 DGX H100' or '4 PCIe nodes') is publicly auditable yet.\n\n3) V100: Derived from ACCRE technical training materials referencing the 'Volta' partition: 4 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs/node = 16 V100s.\n\n4) P100: Derived from ACCRE 'Pascal' partition docs: 28 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 56 P100s.\n\n5) A40: Listed in hardware overview. Assumed 1 node \u00d7 4 GPUs (standard config) or distributed, count is conservative estimate. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

The university has recently (Jan 2024) announced an 'AI Compute Core' with H100s, but exact quantities are not yet in the public hardware specifications, so H100 count is 0 pending verified node counts. Student data is direct from the CS department homepage."
