UW researchers have a dedicated allocation (typically 20%) on the 'Derecho' supercomputer (HPE Cray EX, 2,488 nodes w/ NVIDIA A100s). However, as Derecho is an NSF/UCAR facility and not strictly university-owned hardware, its ~600+ A100s available to UW are excluded from this inventory to strictly reflect university asset ownership."
