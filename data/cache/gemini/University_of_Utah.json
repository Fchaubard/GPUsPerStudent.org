Redwood lists 2 nodes A100 (assume 40GB). Total estimated: 6x4=24 (40GB) + 3x4=12 (80GB). \n4) V100: Redwood (4 nodes x 4) + Notchpeak (General 4 nodes + Owner ~5 nodes) = ~13 nodes x 4 = 52 GPUs.\n\nNote: CHPC uses a 'condo' model where research groups add owner nodes; counts here represent the sum of general resources and documented owner nodes in the facilities description.
