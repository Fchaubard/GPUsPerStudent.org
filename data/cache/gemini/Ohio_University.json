Counts are estimated from DataUSA/IPEDS degree completion data (2022). Undergrad CS estimated from 112 Bachelor's degrees awarded * 4.5 years = 504. Grad (MS) CS estimated from 56 Master's degrees * 1.5 years = 84. PhD counts are aggregated under 'EECS' (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science); estimated CS-specific portion is ~30 based on typical department splits."

    "notes": "Ohio University does not maintain a large-scale, university-owned research computing cluster on premise. Instead, it is a member of the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), a state-funded consortium. OU researchers have access to OSC clusters like 'Ascend' (comprising 88 Dell PowerEdge XE8545 nodes with 4x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs each) and 'Cardnal' (future deployment), but these resources are shared among all Ohio universities and not owned or exclusively allocated to Ohio University. Local labs (like the GRID Lab) utilize workstations (Alienware/HP) rather than HPC nodes."
