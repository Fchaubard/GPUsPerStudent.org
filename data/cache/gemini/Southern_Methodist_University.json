Counts are estimated based on DataUSA/IPEDS 'Degrees Awarded' data for Computer & Information Sciences. Undergrad (BS/BA) estimated as 104 degrees awarded * 4 years = 416. Masters estimated as 479 degrees awarded * 1.5 years = 718 (High count reflects SMU's large online MS Data Science program often grouped with CS). PhD estimated as 10 degrees awarded * 5.5 years = 55. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
