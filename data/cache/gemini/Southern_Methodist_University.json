Counts are estimated based on IPEDS/DataUSA completion data for 'Computer & Information Sciences' (CIP 11.01). Undergrad estimated as 79 degrees awarded * 4 years = 316. Grad (MS) estimated as 253 degrees awarded * 1.5 year avg duration = ~380 (High number reflects SMU's large professional/online MS programs). PhD estimated as 6 degrees * 5.5 years = 33."
