In the most recent reporting year, 20 degrees were awarded in Computer Information Sciences. Assuming a 4-year steady state (20 * 4), the estimated undergraduate CS enrollment is approx 80 students. The university does not offer a dedicated M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science."

Extensive searches for 'HPC', 'Cluster', 'Supercomputer', and 'GPU nodes' on the university domain yielded 0 results. CS instruction relies on standard computer labs and personal devices. No server-grade GPU resources (H100/A100) are publicly documented as owned by the institution. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
