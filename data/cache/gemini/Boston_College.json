Graduate count is estimated: The Fact Book does not break out CS Masters enrollment explicitly in the summary tables, but lists 'Natural Sciences' degrees. The CS department website notes the PhD program admits ~4-6 students/year; assuming a 5-year average duration, steady-state PhD enrollment is estimated at ~22. Masters enrollment is small/nascent, estimated at ~3/year based on degrees conferred in related categories. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

Based on standard cluster size for BC's tier (260 nodes total) and NSF CC* award descriptions (Award #1925466 cited adding '8 GPU nodes'), estimated 6 nodes x 4 GPUs or 12 nodes x 2 GPUs = ~24 V100s. \n2) A100: Documentation confirms presence of A100 nodes in the 'gpu' and 'gpu-long' partitions. Estimated 4 nodes x 4 GPUs = 16 A100s (likely 40GB based on acquisition timing, though 80GB is possible). \n3) H100: No public documentation or press releases indicate the acquisition of H100/Hopper architecture as of mid-2025.

  "analysis_notes": "Boston College operates a centralized 'Linux Cluster' managed by Research Services. Student data is precise for undergraduates via the official Fact Book, but graduate numbers require estimation due to the program's small size and aggregation in high-level reports. GPU counts are derived from cluster documentation descriptions and NSF grant abstracts rather than a live status page."
