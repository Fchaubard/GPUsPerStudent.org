Exact inventory is not live-published, so counts are allocated based on the 500 total figure and the hardware types listed in the User Guide (A100, V100, P100, A6000). \n\nCalculations/Allocations:\n1) A100s: Assuming ~40% of fleet are modern tier (A100s). Split 80GB/40GB based on OIT KB listing both. 200 total A100s estimated.\n2) V100s: Assuming ~28% of fleet (legacy standard). 140 total estimated.\n3) P100s: Assuming ~12% of fleet (older legacy). 60 total estimated.\n4) A6000/RTX: Assuming ~20% of fleet (workstation/scavenger class). 100 total estimated.\n\nTotal = 500 GPUs. H100s not yet explicitly confirmed in public fleet stats as of May 2025, though likely present in private lab purchases."
