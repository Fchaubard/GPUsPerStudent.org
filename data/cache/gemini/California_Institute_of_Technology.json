Caltech Registrar separates Master's and PhD candidates in some summaries, but the 'Enrollment by Option' table combines them into a single Graduate figure. Since Caltech is primarily a PhD-granting institution for grad studies, the majority of these 88 are likely PhD students, but they are listed here under 'grad_cs_count' to match the source label. PhD count set to 0 to avoid double counting, as specific breakdown was not in the primary table. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
