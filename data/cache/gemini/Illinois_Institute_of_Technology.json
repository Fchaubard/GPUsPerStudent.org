(Assumed 80GB as standard for late 2021 research grants, though could be 40GB; categorized here as 80GB for consistency with research tier).\n2) Casbah Cluster (Legacy): OTS page mentions 12 GPU nodes. Based on era (pre-2020), these are estimated as V100s or similar Pascal/Volta generation. Count = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12 V100 (conservative estimate of 1 GPU/node unless specified otherwise).\n3) Chi@IIT (Chameleon Cloud at IIT): Hardware browser confirms presence of P100 nodes at IIT site. 2 nodes \u00d7 2 P100s = 4 P100s.\n\nNote: IIT researchers heavily utilize Argonne National Lab (ThetaGPU/Polaris) resources due to proximity and partnerships, but those are not university-owned assets and are excluded."
