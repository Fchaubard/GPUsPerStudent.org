Based on deployment phases (Phase 14/15/16), estimated ~20 nodes of 80GB (80 GPUs) and ~18 nodes of 40GB (72 GPUs). Total A100s approx 152.\n\n3) V100: Listed as 'gpu_v100' and 'gpu_v100_32g'. Standard configuration is 4 GPUs/node. Historical annual reports cite ~54 V100 nodes. Total: 54 \u00d7 4 = 216 V100s.\n\n4) K80: Legacy nodes (~30 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs) still referenced in some documentation. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
