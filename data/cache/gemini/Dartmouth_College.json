A100: Documentation and grant abstracts reference '4 nodes' of A100s, typically configured as 8x GPUs for large memory jobs. 4 nodes \u00d7 8 GPUs = 32 A100s (Assumed 80GB given 'high memory' description).\n2. V100: Documentation references standard GPU nodes as Quad-V100. Estimating ~16 nodes to balance the cluster generation timeline. 16 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs = 64 V100s.\n3. K80: Legacy hardware making up the remainder of the 35 nodes. ~15 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs = 30 K80s.\n\nNo public record of H100 acquisition as of May 2025.
