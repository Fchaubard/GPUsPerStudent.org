Counts are estimated based on 2022 completion data from IPEDS/DataUSA. Undergraduate: 186 degrees * 4.5 years = 837. Master's: 39 degrees * 2 years = 78. PhD: 4 degrees * 6 years = 24. These estimates align with the 'over 1,000 students' mentioned on CS department welcome pages."

Note: USU researchers also utilize the University of Utah (CHPC) resources, but those are not listed here as they are not USU-owned assets.
