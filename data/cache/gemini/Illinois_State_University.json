Undergrad CS count is estimated at ~60% of the School of IT total (1,911 * 0.60 = 1,146) based on historical department ratios where CS is the dominant major over Cybersecurity and Information Systems. Grad CS count estimated at ~200 based on typical Master's cohort sizes for the school. PhD count is 0 as ISU does not offer a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

    "notes": "Illinois State University is an R2 (High Research Activity) institution that focuses primarily on undergraduate and master's education. Extensive searches for 'HPC', 'Cluster', 'H100', and 'A100' on university domains yield no evidence of a centralized research computing cluster with high-end GPU nodes. Research computing likely relies on individual faculty workstations, teaching labs (specs not public), or external allocations (e.g., ACCESS/NCSA) which are not owned by the university.

While they have a large School of Information Technology (~1,900 students), there is no public footprint of a research-grade GPU cluster (A100/H100). Student counts are derived from the School of IT aggregate numbers found in the Sept 2024 enrollment news release."
