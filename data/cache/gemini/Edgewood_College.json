Counts are estimated based on verifiable degree completion data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES/IPEDS). For the most recent reported year (2023), Edgewood awarded 11 Bachelor's degrees in Computer and Information Sciences. Assuming a standard 4-year duration and steady enrollment, the estimated undergraduate CS population is 11 * 4 = 44. NCES reports 0 Master's and 0 PhD completions in this field, and the college website does not list a graduate CS program."
