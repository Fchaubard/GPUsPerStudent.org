Counts are estimated based on verifiable 2022 degree completion data (latest available via IPEDS/DataUSA). Undergrad estimate: 171 degrees awarded * 4.5 years duration = ~770. Grad (MS) estimate: 19 degrees * 2 years = ~38 (rounded to 40). PhD estimate: 6 degrees * 5.5 years = ~33. These estimates align with the College of Engineering's total enrollment of ~3,354 students, where CS is typically ~25% of the population."

The primary GPU resources are within the Morgan cluster (A100s/V100s) and the KyRIC cluster (P100s). Student counts are derived from IPEDS graduation data due to the lack of a live departmental enrollment dashboard."
