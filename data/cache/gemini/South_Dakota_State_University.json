Undergrad: 5.7% of 2,267 total bachelor degrees = ~129 graduates/year; estimated steady-state enrollment 129 * 4 years = 516.8. Masters: 13.9% of 531 total master's degrees = ~74 graduates/year; estimated enrollment 74 * 2 years = 148. PhD: Program exists but confers low number of degrees annually; estimated at ~20 based on department size and typical faculty-to-student ratios for smaller state programs.
