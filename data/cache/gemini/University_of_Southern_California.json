The University does not explicitly break down CS Graduate enrollment into MS vs PhD on the summary page. PhD count is estimated at ~400 based on USC's typical conferral rate of ~60-70 CS PhDs per year (DataUSA/IPEDS) multiplied by approx 6 years residence, and consistent with the scale of a top-tier research department. MS count is calculated as Total Grad (3,741) - Est. PhD (400) = 3,341. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
