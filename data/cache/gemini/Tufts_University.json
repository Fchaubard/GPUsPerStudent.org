Breakdown estimated based on historical NSF awards and standard node configurations verified in user guides:\n1) V100: 20 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 40 V100s (Correlates with 2019 NSF MRI grant for 16 nodes + standard expansion).\n2) A100: Remaining count to match '60+' total = ~20-24 GPUs. Estimated as 6 nodes \u00d7 4 A100s (PCie) = 24 A100s.\nTotal GPUs = 40 (V100) + 24 (A100) = 64, fitting the '60+' description. No H100s currently listed in public partition documentation.
