In the most recent reported year, Pepperdine awarded approximately 35-40 bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics-Computer Science. Assuming a standard 4-year retention and enrollment pipeline: ~40 graduates * 4 years = ~160 active majors. Graduate and PhD counts are 0 as Pepperdine is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) for sciences and does not have a dedicated CS graduate school.

As a liberal arts-focused university, Pepperdine likely relies on standard teaching labs (workstations) and cloud computing for CS coursework rather than maintaining on-premise H100/A100 data centers found at R1 research universities."

It does not fit the profile of an HPC-heavy research institution. No evidence of a 'research computing' division with hardware specs exists publicly. Student counts reflect the lack of a graduate CS program."
