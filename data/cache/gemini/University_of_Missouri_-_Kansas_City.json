Hellbender Cluster:\n- Standard GPU Nodes: 24 nodes * 4 A100 (80GB) = 96\n- Large Mem GPU Nodes: 2 nodes * 4 A100 (80GB) = 8\n- Interactive GPU Nodes: 3 nodes * 2 A100 (40GB) = 6\nTotal A100 80GB = 104. Total A100 40GB = 6.\n\n2. Lewis Cluster:\n- GPU partition: 20 nodes * 2 V100 = 40 V100. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

No purely UMKC-owned large-scale cluster was found in public documentation, though the School of Science and Engineering likely has smaller isolated lab servers not listed in central audit logs. Student counts are derived from IPEDS completions due to lack of public enrollment grid."
