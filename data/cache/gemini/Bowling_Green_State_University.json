    "notes": "BGSU does not own a publicly specified on-premise research cluster with reportable GPU nodes. The university explicitly directs researchers to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). While BGSU researchers utilize OSC's 'Ascend' (A100s) and 'Pitzer' (V100s) clusters, these are shared state resources, not university-owned hardware. A 2020 NSF grant (Award #2018811) funded a small local compute resource, but specifications and current operational status are not public; therefore, verifiable counts are set to 0 to avoid conflating shared state resources with owned assets.

Unlike larger R1 institutions that maintain both local clusters and external access, BGSU relies almost exclusively on the state-funded OSC for GPU compute. Student data is highly accurate due to ABET accreditation transparency."
