Documentation specifies 252 compute nodes. Each node is equipped with 6x NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\n   Calculation: 252 nodes * 6 GPUs = 1,512 V100 GPUs.\n\n2) The Barn (Landing Pad): Documented as the secondary Linux cluster. Specs list '8 nodes with 4x Tesla V100' and '2 nodes with 8x Tesla V100'.\n   Calculation: (8 * 4) + (2 * 8) = 32 + 16 = 48 V100 GPUs.\n\n3) Architecture Note: RPI's high-performance computing strategy is heavily tied to an IBM partnership (IBM Power9 + NVIDIA V100), rather than standard x86 commodity clusters. Consequently, while the V100 count is extremely high (1,560), there are no public listings for A100 or H100 clusters in the 'docs.cci' public documentation as of mid-2024.
