The university does not explicitly publish a live split of MS vs PhD enrollment on the summary page. PhD/MS counts are estimated based on the 'Degrees Awarded 2022-23' data (69 MS, 29 PhD) and estimated program durations (2 years MS, 5.5 years PhD). Estimated Steady State: (69*2)=138 MS, (29*5.5)=160 PhD. Total estimated pool ~298. Scaling this ratio to the actual 321 enrolled students results in ~149 MS and ~172 PhD.
