    "notes": "Adelphi University is primarily a teaching institution and does not maintain a centralized Research Computing center or public High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster documentation. Departmental facilities pages describe 'computer laboratories' and 'workstations' rather than cluster nodes. No evidence of Datacenter-class GPUs (H100/A100/V100) was found in public grants, IT documentation, or department news. GPU resources are likely limited to individual workstations (e.g., RTX/Quadro series) in the Math/CS labs or cloud-based resources."
