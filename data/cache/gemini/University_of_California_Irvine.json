Total GPU count is officially stated as 'over 500'. \n\nCalculations/Estimates based on this total + Hardware Purchase Options:\n1) A100 80GB: The standard 'High End' option. Estimated 30 nodes x 4 GPUs = 120.\n2) V100: The previous standard (HPC3 launched 2020). Estimated 50 nodes x 4 GPUs = 200.\n3) A100 40GB: Estimated 10 nodes x 4 GPUs = 40 (earlier A100 acquisitions).\n4) Other (P100/A30/RTX): The remaining ~140 GPUs filling out the '500+' total.\n\nNote: No public documentation confirms the presence of H100/H200 nodes in the centralized HPC3 cluster as of early 2025; they may exist in private lab setups not connected to the SLURM grid."
