Undergrad count (533) reflects 'Computer Science' BS enrollment within the College of Engineering and Technology. Grad count (85) includes MS in Computer Science (approx 60) and MS in Software Engineering (approx 25). ECU does not list a standalone Computer Science PhD program; CS faculty participate in interdisciplinary PhD programs (e.g., Biomedical Physics), but there is no specific CS PhD enrollment count.
