As the specific count per model is not itemized on the public summary page, the total (32 nodes) has been allocated based on typical rack configurations for these generations: A100 (est. 4 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs = 16), V100 (est. 8 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs = 16), P100 (est. 8 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs = 16), and K80 (est. 12 older nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs = 48). A100s are assumed to be 40GB PCIE/SXM based on the age of the initial A100 partition deployment."
