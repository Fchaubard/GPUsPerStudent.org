Counts below are estimated based on 'Standard' purchase configurations and 'Infrastructure' page descriptions:\n\n1) A100s: Infrastructure page confirms presence. Purchase configs list 2-GPU nodes. Estimating 4 nodes of 80GB (4x2=8) and 4 nodes of 40GB (4x2=8) based on typical R1 university 'seed' cluster sizes documented in news releases.\n2) V100s: The primary GPU resource for several years. Infrastructure text historically cited '20 GPU nodes' during the V100 era. Calculated as 20 nodes \u00d7 2 GPUs/node = 40 V100s.\n3) A40s: Listed as an available configuration for visualization/AI. Estimated 1 node x 4 GPUs = 4.\n4) P100s: Legacy hardware mentioned in older documentation (2 nodes x 2 GPUs = 4). [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

GPU counts are derived from the 'Standard Configuration' options listed on the pricing page and historical 'Infrastructure' descriptions (e.g., '20 GPU nodes'). Student counts are derived from degrees awarded due to combined EECS department reporting."
