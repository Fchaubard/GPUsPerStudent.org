    "notes": "Biola University does not publish a live enrollment dashboard by major. Counts are estimated based on degree completion data from IPEDS/DataUSA. In 2022, 32 CS Bachelor's degrees were awarded. Assuming a 4-year completion timeline and steady enrollment, total CS undergraduates are estimated at approximately 32 * 4 = 128. Biola does not appear to offer Master's or PhD programs specifically in Computer Science (Graduate programs focus on Theology, Education, Psychology, and Business)."

    "notes": "Biola University is a private Christian university focused on undergraduate teaching and does not maintain a centralized Research Computing / High Performance Computing (HPC) center or a Top500 supercomputer. Computing resources are decentralized in instructional labs (Alton and Lydia Lim Center) utilizing standard workstation hardware (likely consumer-grade RTX cards) rather than data-center class GPUs (H100/A100). No public documentation indicates the presence of an HPC cluster. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
