Main HPC Cluster (referenced in NSF Award 1919632): 2 nodes * 4 V100 GPUs/node = 8 V100s total.\n\nNote: No public evidence was found of newer A100 or H100 acquisitions in public procurement records or IT announcements as of mid-2024. The university likely supplements on-premise hardware with cloud resources or collaborative access (e.g., NYSERNet) for larger workloads."
