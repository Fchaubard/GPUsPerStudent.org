Specific 'Computer Science' major counts are estimated using degree completion data. Undergrad CS estimated: 432 BS degrees (DataUSA/IPEDS) * 4 years = 1,728. Grad CS estimated: 232 MS degrees * 2 years = 464. PhD count (177) is taken directly from the DePaul Fact File for CDM Doctoral enrollment, as the doctoral programs in this college are exclusively computing/HCI focused.

While the College of Computing and Digital Media (CDM) mentions managing a 'specialized high performance computing cluster,' no node counts or GPU models are listed on public pages or research computing documentation. NSF awards indicate the existence of older legacy GPU nodes (circa 2017), but current verifiable counts for modern datacenter GPUs (H100/A100) are 0 based on public data.
