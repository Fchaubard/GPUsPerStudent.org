  "analysis_notes": "Brown's computing landscape is split between the central 'Oscar' cluster (CCV) and smaller CS department resources ('The Grid'). The Oscar cluster has a high node count (216 GPU nodes) but a significant portion utilizes consumer-grade hardware (RTX series) rather than exclusively data-center class cards (H100/A100), reflecting a cost-effective strategy for broad student access."
