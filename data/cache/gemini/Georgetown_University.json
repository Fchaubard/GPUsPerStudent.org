Derived from NSF Award 2117533 ($400k grant in 2021/2022). This funding amount typically covers one DGX A100 or HGX A100 system (8 GPUs) plus infrastructure. Documentation references a specific 'a100' slurm partition.\n\n2) V100 Count: 8. Sourced from older UIS Research Technologies specifications listing '2 GPU nodes with 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs each'.\n\nNote: The university emphasizes cloud credits and shared resources (MDI) over large on-premise clusters.
