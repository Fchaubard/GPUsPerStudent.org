'PhD' count uses the 'Computational Analysis & Modeling' (CAM) program (27) as it is the primary interdisciplinary doctoral program for CS research at LaTech; there is also a 'PhD in Engineering' (114 total) which includes Cyberspace Engineering students, but the specific CS/Cyber breakdown is not listed, so the CAM number is used as a verified minimum.

    "notes": "GPU Count Estimation: The NSF Award #2215967 (active 2022-2025) funded a cluster with 'two GPU nodes' equipped with 'NVIDIA A100 GPUs'. The budget ($450k) and standard HPC configurations for that period typically include 4x GPUs per node. Therefore, the total is estimated at 2 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs = 8 A100s. VRAM is assumed 80GB given the 'AI and Data Science' research focus of the grant. NOTE: Louisiana Tech is also a member of LONI (Louisiana Optical Network Infrastructure) giving access to the 'QB3' cluster (44x V100s shared across LA universities), but these are not listed here as they are not university-owned local resources."
