Counts are estimated based on NCES IPEDS data (College Navigator) for the most recent reporting year (2023). Undergrad count estimated by multiplying the annual degrees awarded (29 Computer & Info Sci bachelor's degrees) by 4 years = 116 students. Graduate and PhD counts are 0 as the department does not list an MS or PhD program in Computer Science."

While individual workstations in the 'Computer Science Lab' or 'Systems Lab' likely contain consumer-grade GPUs for instruction, no public specifications, node counts, or enterprise-grade GPU resources (H100/A100) are listed in university facility documentation or IT service catalogs.
