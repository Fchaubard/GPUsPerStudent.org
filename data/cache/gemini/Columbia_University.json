Calculation: 24 \u00d7 2 = 48 V100 GPUs.\n   - Source specifies '18 GPU nodes' with '2x P100'. Calculation: 18 \u00d7 2 = 36 P100 GPUs.\n\nNote: Columbia CUIT operates on a condominium model; numbers represent the base/documented cluster size from the Fall 2023 flyer, though individual research groups may have purchased additional buy-in nodes (exact count of buy-in expansion not public).

The 'Ginsberg' cluster is the primary H100/A100 class resource, though public docs currently only confirm A100s. The 'Terremoto' cluster is older but listed as active legacy hardware. Student counts are direct from the CS department overview."
