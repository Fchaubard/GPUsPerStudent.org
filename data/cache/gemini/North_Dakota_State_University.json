Based on typical CCAST config (mix of 2x and 4x nodes): Estimated 30 nodes @ 2x V100 + 2 nodes @ 4x V100 = 68 V100s. (Specs imply V100 16GB/32GB mix).\n\n3) P100: Legacy nodes often retained. Estimated 12 nodes x 2 P100 = 24 P100s based on previous annual reports for Thunder cluster.\n\nTotal estimated GPU count ~130 across all generations (K40 to A100).
