    "notes": "Extensive searches for 'HPC', 'Cluster', 'GPU', 'H100', 'A100', and 'Slurm' on the Andrews University domain yielded no evidence of an on-premise research computing cluster. The Department of Computing website lists standard instructional labs (Windows/Linux workstations) but no datacenter-class GPU resources. As a smaller liberal arts institution (~3,000 students), it likely relies on cloud resources or individual workstations for any necessary GPU compute.
