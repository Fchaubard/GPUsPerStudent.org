Counts are estimated based on the most recent NCES IPEDS completion data (2022-2023). 11 Bachelor's degrees were awarded in Computer & Information Sciences; assuming a 4-year program steady state (11 * 4 = 44 enrolled). While the university advertises an M.S. in Cybersecurity on their website, IPEDS reports 0 completions for Computer Science or Protective Services (Cybersecurity) at the Master's level for the reported year, suggesting the program is new or currently has negligible enrollment."
