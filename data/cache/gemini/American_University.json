Legacy specifications identify these as equipped with 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs each (Total: 2 nodes \u00d7 4 GPUs = 8 V100s). No evidence of newer A100/H100 acquisitions in public procurement records or news releases. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

Student counts are estimated from degree awards due to lack of public enrollment manifests. GPU resources are based on the 'Zorro' cluster specs; newer hardware may exist in isolated labs but is not part of the central research computing shared facility."
