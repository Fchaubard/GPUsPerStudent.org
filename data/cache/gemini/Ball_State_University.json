Undergrad estimate: 139 degrees awarded \u00d7 4 years = 556. Grad estimate: 41 degrees awarded \u00d7 2 years = 82. The Computer Science department website confirms they offer Bachelor's and Master's degrees, but no PhD program."

The Computer Science department relies on workstation labs and likely cloud resources or external supercomputing access (e.g., ACCESS/XSEDE) for research needs. No owned data center GPU resources (H100/A100) were found in public documentation. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
