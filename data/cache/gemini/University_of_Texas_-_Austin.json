Therefore, the 600 units are listed under 'gh200_count' rather than 'h100_sxm_count' to reflect the architecture accurately.\n\n2) TACC Lonestar6: 32 GPU nodes x 3 NVIDIA A100 GPUs/node = 96 A100s. Specs specify 40GB memory.\n\n3) TACC Frontera: 90 GPU nodes x 4 NVIDIA RTX 5000/node = 360 GPUs.\n\nNOTE ON TACC: The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is a research center at UT Austin. While it serves as a national resource (NSF), it is the primary research computing facility for UT Austin faculty and students."

Student data is notable for the extremely high Master's enrollment due to the online MSCS/MSAI programs, which skews the student-to-GPU ratio compared to traditional residential programs."
