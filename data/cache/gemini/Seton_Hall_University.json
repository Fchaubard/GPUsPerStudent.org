Undergrad CS estimated: 35 degrees awarded * 4 years = 140 students. Grad CS/Data Science estimated: 29 degrees awarded * 2 years (standard MS duration) = 58 students. Seton Hall does not currently offer a PhD in Computer Science."

While Seton Hall mentions a 'High Performance Computing' service and 'Linux cluster' on their technology services website, the page is a generic service description with no node inventory, GPU models, or counts listed. Access to specification details appears restricted to the 'mySHU' intranet. Consequently, verifiable counts are set to 0."
