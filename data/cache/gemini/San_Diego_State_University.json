No public documentation exists for a central, university-owned research cluster with significant H100/A100 resources. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

Unlike R1 universities with dedicated 'Research Computing' centers hosting local clusters (like Stanford's Sherlock), SDSU leverages its proximity to SDSC. Therefore, while student counts are high, auditable on-premise GPU counts are 0 based on public web data."
