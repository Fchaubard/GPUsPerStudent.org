Undergrad CS Estimate: 125 'Computer Science' Bachelor's degrees awarded * 4 years = 500 (Note: This excludes the large Cybersecurity program which had 147 completions). Grad CS Estimate: 59 'Computer Science' Master's degrees * 2 years = 118. PhD count is 0 as the university does not offer a Computer Science PhD."

While it has a robust Computer Science and Cybersecurity student population, it does not maintain the capital-intensive HPC infrastructure (H100/A100 clusters) typical of research universities, relying instead on cloud providers."
