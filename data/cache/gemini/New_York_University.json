Tandon reports ~3,000 undergrads total with CS being the largest major (~45% est = ~1,350). Courant (CAS) website states 'over 1,000 undergraduate majors'. Tandon graduate enrollment is very high (~3,700 total), with CS/Cybersecurity/AI comprising ~40-50% (~1,500). Courant graduate programs add ~350 MS and ~150 PhD students. PhD count combines Tandon (~160) and Courant (~150) based on department size pages. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
