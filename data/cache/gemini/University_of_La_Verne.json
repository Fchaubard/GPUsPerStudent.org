Undergrad: ~40 BS Computer Science degrees awarded annually; assuming 4.5-year retention/completion, estimated enrollment is 40 * 4.5 = 180. Grad: 83 Master's degrees awarded in CIS fields (primarily Data Analytics and General CS); assuming 2-year program duration, estimated enrollment is 83 * 2 = 166. PhD: The university does not offer a PhD in Computer Science (verified via catalog)."

Computer Science and Data Analytics students utilize standard computer labs (Founders Hall) and likely personal devices or cloud resources for coursework. No evidence of on-premise high-performance research computing infrastructure (A100/H100 clusters) exists. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
