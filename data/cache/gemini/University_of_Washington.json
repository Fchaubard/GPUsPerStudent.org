Split estimated as 140 (80GB) and 120 (40GB) based on the mix of 'gpu-a100-80g' and 'gpu-a100-40g' nodes (4 GPUs/node).\n2) A40 (Visualization/ML): Estimated 80 GPUs (approx 10 nodes x 8 GPUs/node).\n3) L40/L40S (New Additions): Estimated 64 GPUs (approx 8 nodes x 8 GPUs/node) - listed as 'gpu-l40' in docs.\n4) V100 (Legacy from Mox cluster): Estimated 100 GPUs (approx 25 nodes x 4 GPUs/node).\nTotal Estimated = 140+120+80+64+100 = 504 GPUs, aligning with the 'Over 500' official figure.\n\nNOTE ON H100: While the Allen School likely possesses H100s in private partitions, they are not currently listed in the public 'Klone Hardware' documentation or the 'Scheduling Resources' page as a general availability partition, so count is set to 0 pending public verification."
