A40 (Standard Node): Documented as the 'standard' GPU node type. Estimated ~60% of cluster (96 nodes) x 4 GPUs/node = 384 A40s.\n2. A100 (High Performance): Estimated ~20% of cluster (32 nodes) split between 40GB/80GB. 20 nodes x 4 (40GB) = 80 GPUs; 12 nodes x 4 (80GB) = 48 GPUs.\n3. V100 (Legacy/Transfer): Estimated ~10% of cluster (12 nodes) x 4 GPUs/node = 48 V100s.\n\nNote: UW Hyak operates on a 'condo' model where exact live counts fluctuate as groups buy nodes. H100s not explicitly confirmed in public Hyak docs as of mid-2024; UW heavily utilizes cloud credits (CloudBank) for latest-gen hardware."

GPU data relies on 'Hyak Klone' cluster specs (node types verified: 4xA40, 4xA100, 4xV100) and cluster size reports (~140-160 GPU nodes). Exact breakdown by model is estimated based on 'standard' vs 'specialized' descriptions in documentation."
