This is the primary AI research cluster.\n\n2) FASRC Cannon Cluster (Estimates based on partition documentation & public specs): \n   - V100: The 'gpu' partition historically contained ~200+ V100 GPUs (legacy 'water-cooled' partition). Estimated at 200.\n   - A100: Public docs confirm presence of A100 nodes. Conservative estimate of 32x 80GB and 64x 40GB based on typical condo-cluster ratios seen in peer institutions (12-16 nodes), though exact dynamic inventory is hidden behind login.\n\n3) Total H100 count is verifiable and exact (384). Older generation counts are conservative estimates based on cluster age and 'condo' model descriptions. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"
