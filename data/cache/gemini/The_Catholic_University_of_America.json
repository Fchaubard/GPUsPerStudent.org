The exact count of GPUs per node is not publicly detailed in open documentation, but standard configuration for this grant size ($300k total for cluster) is typically 2x GPUs per GPU node. Total calculated as: 2 nodes \u00d7 2 V100 = 4 V100s. No evidence of newer H100/A100 acquisitions found in public records."
