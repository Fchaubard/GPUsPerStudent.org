Counts are estimated based on the most recent verifiable degree completion data from IPEDS/DataUSA (2022). Undergrad estimate: 47 Bachelor's degrees awarded in Computer & Info Sciences \u00d7 4 years = 188 students. Grad estimate: 97 Master's degrees awarded (reflecting strong enrollment in Katz School MS AI/Data programs) \u00d7 1.5 years (typical duration) = ~146 students. No Computer Science PhD program is listed in the academic catalog; YU offers PhDs in Math and sciences, but CS is Master's focused."

    "notes": "Exhaustive search of Yeshiva University and Katz School of Science and Health websites (including 'research computing', 'HPC', and 'cluster' queries) yields no evidence of a centralized, university-owned HPC cluster with verifiable GPU specifications (e.g., node counts, GPU models). The curriculum and research descriptions explicitly emphasize 'cloud-based architecture' and 'cloud platforms' (AWS/GCP) rather than on-premise supercomputing infrastructure. While individual labs (e.g., Distributed Systems Lab) mention 'servers', no auditable hardware list exists."
