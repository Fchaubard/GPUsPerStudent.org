    "notes": "CMU HPC Cluster (funded by NSF MRI #1919616): Specification lists '2 GPU nodes'. Press releases identify the hardware as Dell PowerEdge (likely C4140 based on 2019 MRI timing/budget) with 'NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs'. Standard configuration for Dell GPU nodes in this class is 4x GPUs per node. Estimated Total: 2 nodes * 4 V100 = 8 V100 GPUs. No newer clusters (A100/H100) found in public documentation or newer NSF awards as of late 2024. [WARNING: Original source was inaccessible, using fallback.]"

No evidence of newer A100/H100 acquisitions found in public NSF award databases or IT news releases. CS PhD count is 0 as the university does not appear to offer a standalone CS doctorate."
