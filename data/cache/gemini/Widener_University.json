High-end workstations in the Computing and Simulation Lab (GPUs unspecified, likely Quadro/RTX class, but not cluster nodes).\n2. External resources (faculty publications indicate usage of national supercomputing resources like XSEDE/ACCESS for heavy compute tasks).\n\nExtensive searches for 'Widener University HPC', 'Widener GPU cluster', and 'Widener Research Computing' yielded no specifications for on-premise infrastructure.

Student counts are derived from federal graduation data (IPEDS) as direct enrollment reports by major are unavailable. GPU resources are 0 as the university relies on workstations and external partnerships rather than maintaining a local HPC data center."
