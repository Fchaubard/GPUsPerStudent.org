Undergrad CS estimated: 56 degrees awarded/year * 4 years = 224. Grad CS (includes Applied AI, Data Science, and Cyber Security MS programs) estimated: 131 degrees awarded/year * 1.5 year avg duration = 197. PhD count is 0 as the University of San Diego is a doctoral university but does not offer a PhD specifically in Computer Science."

    "notes": "The University of San Diego (USD) is a private institution distinct from UC San Diego (UCSD). Extensive searches for 'University of San Diego research computing', 'HPC', and 'GPU cluster' yield no evidence of an on-premise research computing center or GPU cluster. The Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering facilities page lists physical fabrication labs but no computing clusters. It appears the university relies on cloud resources or external partnerships (e.g., San Diego Supercomputer Center at UCSD) for research computing needs.
