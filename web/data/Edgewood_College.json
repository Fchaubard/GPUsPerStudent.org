Found an official Edgewood University document explicitly labeled 2024-2025 (PCS Annual Report), but it contains counseling utilization metrics and student characteristics\u2014not enrollment-by-major (no CS/CIS headcount). No public Edgewood source explicitly labeled AY 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 was found that reports CS/CIS enrollment headcount; therefore counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on similar small colleges. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on similar small colleges. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on similar small colleges. Will contact university for accurate data."
