Tried the requested search order (Fall 2024 CS enrollment; CS department facts; Common Data Set 2024-2025; registrar/enrollment statistics; and related UTulsa pages). UTulsa\u2019s Institutional Research & Data Analytics page provides student outcomes dashboards and a data request form but does not publish CS enrollment headcounts by level (BS vs MS vs PhD) for Fall 2024/AY 2024-25. A commonly cited UTulsa 'Common Data Set' URL path returned 404, and no official UTulsa CDS 2024-2025 PDF/page with CS enrollment counts was found via web search. Therefore, no acceptable 2024+ CS enrollment numbers could be verified. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department presence. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS department presence. Will contact university for accurate data."
