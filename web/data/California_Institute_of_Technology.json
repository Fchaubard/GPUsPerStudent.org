Graduate CS count (120) and PhD count (80) are estimates derived by Claude based on total engineering enrollment figures, as specific department breakdowns were not explicitly detailed in the Common Data Set. Gemini found 88 total graduate students but Claude's estimate is higher, so it is used per aggregation rules."
