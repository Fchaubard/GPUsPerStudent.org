Found an official post explicitly titled \"2024-2025 University Fact Book Release\" (posted 2025-11-19) that links to the 2024-2025 Fact Book, but the Fact Book file is hosted on Google Drive and is not publicly accessible (returns 401 Unauthorized), so no CS enrollment numbers can be verified/extracted from it. Also searched for a 2024-2025 Common Data Set (CDS), registrar enrollment statistics, and CS department facts pages containing explicit 2024/Fall 2024 dated CS enrollment counts; none were found. Rejected third-party enrollment pages that only provide 2023-2024 (or earlier) data. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on smaller university size. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on smaller university size. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on smaller university size. Will contact university for accurate data."

Therefore, all GPU totals are set to 0 and there are no nodes\u00d7GPUs_per_node calculations to report. If SMUMN uses external shared HPC resources (e.g., via partner institutions), that was not documented in the sources above as an SMUMN cluster with specs."
