In the College of Science (SC) section, major code \"CS\" shows Undergraduate (This Year/Fall 2024) = 662 and Graduate (This Year/Fall 2024) = 133, Total (This Year/Fall 2024) = 795. HOWEVER, this report has only a single \"Graduate\" column (not split into Master's vs Doctoral/PhD), so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0 to avoid misclassifying MS vs PhD students. (Combined graduate CS headcount shown is 133.)"

Sources indicate: (a) 24 GPUs total (UAH announcement) and (b) 24 GPU-enabled nodes (NSF award summary), consistent with 24 nodes \u00d7 1 GPU/node = 24 GPUs total. GPU model is not explicitly listed; UAH news describes them as Nvidia \"Ampere\" and gives ~160,000 CUDA cores, which closely matches 24 \u00d7 6,912 CUDA cores = 165,888 (NVIDIA A100). Because A100 40GB vs 80GB is not specified, I assigned all 24 as A100 80GB for the requested rollup; if those GPUs are actually A100 40GB, then the correct breakdown would be a100_40gb_count=24 and a100_80gb_count=0."
