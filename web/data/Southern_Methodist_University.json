Gemini estimated higher counts (Undergrad: 416, Grad: 718, PhD: 55) based on IPEDS 'Degrees Awarded' data multiplied by program duration. OpenAI found specific Fall 2024 Registrar data showing lower confirmed enrollment (Undergrad: 230, Grad: 227, PhD: 43). The Grad estimate of 718 likely includes large online MS Data Science programs often grouped with CS in federal reporting."
