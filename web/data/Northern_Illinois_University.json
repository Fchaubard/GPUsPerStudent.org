(https://www.cs.niu.edu/)\n\nSearches attempted (per your requested strategy and similar queries):\n- Looked for \u201cNorthern Illinois University computer science enrollment Fall 2024\u201d, \u201cNIU CS department facts 2024\u201d, registrar/institutional research \u2018enrollment by major\u2019 dashboards/reports, and a NIU Common Data Set 2024-2025.\n- Found multiple sources for overall NIU Fall 2024 enrollment (e.g., 10-day count / overall enrollment news) but none provided CS-major headcount broken out into undergrad vs MS vs PhD with an explicit Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 label.\n\nBecause no qualifying 2024+ CS enrollment counts were found, all counts are set to 0 per your instructions."
