I did not find an official Notre Dame source that explicitly states AY 2024-25 or Fall 2024 headcounts for MSCSE (master's-only) or CSE PhD students; Graduate School program pages list program details and were verified/updated (9/23/25) but do not provide enrollment counts, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."

These may overlap with the ND Condor host list (CAML is accessed via HTCondor), so CAML GPUs were NOT added again on top of the Condor-host-derived RTX 6000/V100 totals to avoid double counting."
