    "notes": "Searched for Immaculata University Computer Science (incl. Applied Computer Science) student enrollment counts specifically for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025. The official Common Data Set labeled \u201cCommon Data Set 2024-2025\u201d explicitly reports institutional enrollment as of the official fall reporting date / October 15, 2024 (Fall 2024), but it does NOT provide enrollment/headcount by major/department (no CS major enrollment table). The CDS includes only overall headcount totals (undergraduate/graduate) and degree-completion percentages by CIP, which are not CS enrollment counts. Additional searches of Immaculata\u2019s program/department pages did not yield any Fall 2024 CS major headcount. Therefore, CS-specific enrollment counts could not be verified for 2024+ and are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on small university size. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on small university size. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on small university size. Will contact university for accurate data."
