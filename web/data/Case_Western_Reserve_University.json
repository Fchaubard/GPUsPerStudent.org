The row \u201cComputer Science (BA and BS)\u201d shows 571 for Fall 2024. The page notes this enrollment figure reflects \u201csophomore, junior and senior declared Majors\u201d (so it excludes first-year students and is undergrad-only). I did not find any public CWRU source that explicitly lists Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 headcount for MS-only Computer Science students or CS PhD students (separate from other programs), so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0 per your requirements."
