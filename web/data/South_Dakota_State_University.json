In the row 'B.S. computer science', the 'Enrollment (Fall 2024)' value is 207 (undergraduate majors). I could not find any publicly posted, program-specific (Computer Science) Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 enrollment counts for M.S.-only or Ph.D.-only Computer Science on SDSU\u2019s public pages (most sources either report university-wide totals or require interactive dashboards), so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0.
