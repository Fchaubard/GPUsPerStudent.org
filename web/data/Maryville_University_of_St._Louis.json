    "notes": "Verified this official Maryville University Office of Institutional Research PDF explicitly contains Fall 2024 census enrollment (it shows \"CENSUS FALL 2024\" and \"Census Date 2024: Sept 23, 2024\") and a \"Last Updated: Febuary 11, 2025\" stamp. However, the report only provides institution-wide enrollment totals (e.g., total enrollment, total undergraduates, and total graduates incl. doctorate) and does NOT break enrollment down by major/department (no Computer Science-specific headcount for undergrad/masters/PhD). I also checked Maryville\u2019s Common Data Set 2024-2025 (official PDF) and it similarly reports overall enrollment but does not provide Computer Science major enrollment counts. Therefore, CS-specific enrollment counts for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-2025 were not found in available official 2024+ sources, so counts are set to 0."

Maryville pages found describe AI initiatives and cyber labs (Virtual Lab / Cyber Fusion Center) but do not provide GPU model inventories or node/GPU counts. Therefore all requested GPU totals are set to 0 (no clusters with quantifiable specs found), and no model estimation was applied because no GPU counts were published to estimate from."
