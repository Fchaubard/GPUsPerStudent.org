    "notes": "From an IUP News post dated 10/23/24 (Fall 2024). The article states: \"The IUP cybersecurity program has more than 130 students enrolled\" and that these students are in the bachelor\u2019s degree \"Computer Science/Cybersecurity track.\" I used 130 as a conservative minimum (the page says 'more than 130', not an exact count). I did not find any Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25 source on iup.edu that reports enrollment counts for (a) the overall Computer Science major (beyond the Cybersecurity track), (b) an MS/Masters Computer Science program, or (c) a PhD Computer Science program, so grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0."

    "notes": "Publicly accessible IUP sources (searched for IUP research computing GPU clusters; H100/A100 specs; AI computing infrastructure) did not provide any cluster GPU hardware specifications (GPU model/type), GPU-per-node, node counts, or total GPU counts for any IUP cluster. Clusters/resources named in public sources: (1) PEPPER (LittleFe portable teaching cluster): no GPU info; treated as 0 GPUs. (2) Penrose Cluster: described as software packages; no hardware/GPU info; treated as 0 GPUs. Therefore totals for H100/H200/A100/V100/P100/A6000/L40S = 0. No basis to estimate models because no GPU quantities were provided."
