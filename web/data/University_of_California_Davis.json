These dashboards appear to include AY 2024-25 in their year options and show a \u201cdata updated\u201d timestamp in 2025, but the CS-specific counts require interactive filtering/drill-down (e.g., selecting the Computer Science major/program and degree type). In this environment I was only able to retrieve static thumbnail images without the necessary drill-down tables/crosstabs for Computer Science, so I could not verify or quote CS counts for 2024+.\n\nPer your rules, I am rejecting older-year CS enrollment figures (2023 or earlier) and returning 0s."
