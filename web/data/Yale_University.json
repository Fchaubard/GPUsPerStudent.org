Note: There may be some overlap in the 12 Milgram GPUs, but max values are retained per rules.\n- A100 80GB: 148 total (dominated by 128 in McCleary + 20 in Grace).\n- L40s: 88 total (Bouchet, Hopper, Misha).\n- Older hardware (V100/A100-40GB) located primarily in Grace and McCleary clusters."

Yale has made significant recent upgrades via the Provost's AI Initiative (adding H200/H100s to Bouchet, Hopper, and Misha), complementing the existing heavy compute capacity in McCleary (A100s). Student counts are best estimates combining website statements with degree conferral analysis.",
