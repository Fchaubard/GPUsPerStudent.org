JOHN FISHER UNIVERSITY - INSTITUTIONAL ONE YEAR FACTBOOK (FALL 2024 CENSUS)\" and is dated \"OIR:AB_2/12/2025\" (bottom right). It reports total Fall 2024 enrollment (Undergraduate 2,583; Master's 779; Doctoral 368; Total 3,730) and enrollment by SCHOOL & level (e.g., Arts and Sciences undergraduate 1,102), but it does NOT provide enrollment by MAJOR (e.g., Computer Science headcount). Therefore CS undergrad/masters/PhD enrollment counts cannot be extracted from this Fall 2024 census fact sheet, so counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on the size of the university. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on the size of the university. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on the size of the university. Will contact university for accurate data."
