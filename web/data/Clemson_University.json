Additional A100s are present in the 'latest compute nodes' (Ice Lake phase).\n- V100: Includes a DGX-2 system (16 V100s) and a benchmark partition consisting of 220 nodes with either V100 or A100 (estimated 250+ V100s across the heterogeneous system).\n\n2) Secretariat (IHG Cluster): \n- 1x NVIDIA DGX node: 8x A100 80GB.\n- 2x R760XA nodes: 1x H100 NVL 188GB each (treated as 2x H100 PCIe equivalent) = 4 GPUs.\n- 1x R760 node: 2x L40S 48GB.\n\nFINAL ESTIMATED TOTALS:\n- H100 SXM = 80 (Hopper specialized nodes)\n- H100 PCIe = 4 (Secretariat NVL cards)\n- A100 80GB = 48 (Secretariat 8 + Palmetto known nodes 40)\n- L40S = 2 (Secretariat)\n- V100/A100/P100/Legacy: The remaining ~1280 GPUs are distributed across the legacy phases of the Palmetto condominium cluster, which remains one of the largest academic heterogeneous systems in the US.
