Found an official UC San Diego Institutional Research Common Data Set explicitly labeled 2024\u20132025 and containing Fall 2024 overall enrollment totals (and graduate totals) as of Oct 15, 2024, but it does NOT provide enrollment by major/department (no CS/CSE-specific headcount, and no MS-only vs PhD-only breakdown by major). Also checked UCSD CSE Department Annual Report 2024 site, which is explicitly 2024, but it did not expose (in accessible page text) numeric student headcounts by degree level (undergrad vs MS vs PhD). Therefore, no acceptable 2024+ CS-specific enrollment numbers were located; counts set to 0 per instructions."
