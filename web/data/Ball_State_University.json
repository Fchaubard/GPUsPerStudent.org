However, this CDS provides only institution-wide enrollment totals (e.g., Total all undergraduates = 15,189; Total all graduate = 5,900; GRAND TOTAL ALL STUDENTS = 21,089 in Section B1) and does NOT provide enrollment counts by major/department (Computer Science) or by CS degree level (BS/BA vs MS vs PhD). Because no Ball State source with explicit 2024-2025/Fall 2024 Computer Science-major headcount was found in the searched sources, the CS-specific counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated at 150, grad_cs_count is estimated at 50, and phd_cs_count is estimated at 10 based on university size and CS department presence. Will contact university for accurate data."
