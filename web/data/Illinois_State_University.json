Both are explicitly dated 2024/2024-2025 but only report institution-level enrollment (not Computer Science major/program enrollment by degree level). The PRPA site indicates major-level enrollment is available via Power BI 'Enrollment Dashboards (Fall 2015 through Current Term)', but those dashboards are hosted on app.powerbi.com and I could not retrieve a CS-major headcount for Fall 2024 from a static, citable page. Because no page I could cite explicitly states Computer Science enrollment counts for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-25, all CS counts are set to 0 per your instructions."

GPUs-per-node is not stated publicly on the cited pages, so an estimate is required to compute totals. Estimated GPUs_per_node=2 (typical small university HPC GPU-node configuration for V100S-era systems). Calculation: 2 GPU nodes \u00d7 2 V100S per node (estimated) = 4 total V100S, counted under v100_count.
