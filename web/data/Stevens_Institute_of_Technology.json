However, this document does NOT provide Computer Science-major enrollment headcounts (UG vs MS vs PhD) for Fall 2024/AY 2024-2025. I also attempted to use Stevens\u2019 official ABET enrollment/graduation resource (linked from the Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness), but it resolves to an embedded Microsoft Power BI report that did not expose program-level counts in a non-interactive, citable page via this environment. Per your rules, I am not using any 2023-or-earlier CS counts, so all CS-specific counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program reputation. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program reputation. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program reputation. Will contact university for accurate data."
