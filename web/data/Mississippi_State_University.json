OpenAI found specific official census data for Fall 2024 (IHL Fact Book) showing 569 undergrads and 173 grads in CIP code 11 (Computer/Info Sciences), but could not distinguish PhDs. Gemini estimated 798 undergrads based on ABET data."

A100 count (138) comes from OpenAI's sum of Atlas (40), Ptolemy (66), and Morrill (32 estimated) clusters. Gemini identified 'Hercules' with 120 A100s, which may overlap with Ptolemy/Morrill, but the higher aggregate of 138 is used. V100 count (32) includes Atlas nodes and DGX-2 systems identified by Gemini. L40S count (48) identified in Atlas cluster by OpenAI."

Significant disparity in GPU identification: Claude classified the SuperPOD as H100-based, while other models focused on A100 clusters (Ptolemy, Hercules, Atlas).
