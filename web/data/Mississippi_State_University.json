    "notes": "Source is the IHL (Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning) 'FALL 2024 Enrollment Fact Book' (census taken on November 1, 2024). In the table 'On-Campus Undergraduate Headcount Enrollment By Program Category (Fall 2024)', Mississippi State University shows 569 students in the two-digit CIP category 'Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services - 11'. In the table 'On-Campus Graduate Headcount Enrollment By Program Category (Fall 2024)', MSU shows 173 graduate students in the same CIP category, but it does NOT break graduate enrollment into Master's vs PhD; therefore grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count are set to 0 (unable to separate MS vs PhD from this Fall 2024 source). Also note: CIP category 11 is broader than 'Computer Science' and may include multiple computing-related majors."
