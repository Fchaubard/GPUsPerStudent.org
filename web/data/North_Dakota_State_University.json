Found NDSU OIRA Fall 2024 enrollment census summary (Term: Fall 2024 (2510), dated Sept 24, 2024) but it reports university/college-level totals only and does NOT provide enrollment by major/program (so it cannot yield CS-only counts). Found NDSU CS Department 'About' page that explicitly says 'As of 2024' and gives approximate counts (~400 undergraduate students; ~140 graduate students in BOTH computer science and software engineering), but it does NOT separate Computer Science vs Software Engineering, and does NOT split graduate students into MS vs PhD. Because no source with explicit 2024-2025/Fall 2024 CS-only enrollment with MS vs PhD split was found, all counts are set to 0."
