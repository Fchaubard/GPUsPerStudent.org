Estimated K20 based on being built from decommissioned Colonial One hardware. Assumed 2 GPUs/node \u00d7 4 nodes = 8 Tesla K20 GPUs (estimate).\n\nNOT COUNTED:\n- Colonial One hardware inventory not added to totals because Colonial One was decommissioned (scheduled complete July 15, 2020) and its hardware is described as legacy/out-of-support.\n- Viper/Raptor: no public GPU node specifications found in the queried sources; therefore no GPU counts included for them.\n- L40S: mentioned by GW IT as part of Pegasus expansion, but no public node/GPU counts found, so l40s_count left as 0."
