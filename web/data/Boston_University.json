I found Boston University\u2019s Common Data Set 2024-2025 PDF (explicitly labeled \u201c2024-2025\u201d and includes a table labeled \u201cB1. Institutional enrollment \u2026 (Fall 2024)\u201d; the CDS landing page lists \u201cLast updated: March 2025\u201d). However, this source reports ONLY overall BU enrollment totals (undergraduate and graduate/professional) and does NOT provide enrollment headcounts by major/program such as \u201cComputer Science,\u201d nor does it split graduate enrollment into MS vs PhD for CS. I also checked BU\u2019s ASIR Fact Book \u2018Student Enrollment\u2019 page and BU Graduate Education \u2018PhD Program Profiles\u2019 pages, but their CS-specific metrics appear to be embedded in interactive dashboards/pages that require JavaScript and did not expose any static Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25 CS enrollment headcounts on the publicly accessible page content. Therefore, no verifiable 2024+ BU CS enrollment headcounts (UG / MS / PhD) were found from public, non-JS-embedded sources, so all counts are set to 0 per instructions."
