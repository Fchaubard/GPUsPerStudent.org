Adelphi's Institutional Research 'Data' page lists Common Data Set PDFs only through 2022-2023 (older than allowed), and the CDS PDFs are hosted on intranet.adelphi.edu which redirects to Microsoft login when opened. Adelphi's data dashboards (class.adelphi.edu/data-dashboards/) also redirect to Microsoft login, preventing access to any Fall 2024 by-program/major headcount (including CS). Public-facing pages (e.g., Facts About Adelphi and the Computer Science program page) mention Fall 2024 in limited contexts (e.g., student-faculty ratio) but do not provide Computer Science student enrollment headcounts for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025. Therefore, no compliant (2024/2024-2025/Fall 2024 explicitly stated) CS enrollment counts could be retrieved from publicly accessible sources. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program offerings. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program offerings. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: phd_cs_count is estimated based on university size and CS program offerings. Will contact university for accurate data."
