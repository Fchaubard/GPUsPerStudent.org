    "notes": "Searched for UPenn CS/CIS enrollment counts specifically for Fall 2024 / AY 2024-25. The official IR&A Quick Facts page explicitly lists \u201cFall 2024 / Academic Year 2025\u201d PDFs, but they are hosted on upenn.box.com and were not accessible in a non-JavaScript environment (only a JS-disabled message was retrievable), so no CS/CIS major-by-major enrollment counts could be extracted/verified from the 2024-25 Quick Facts PDFs. Checked Penn CIS and Penn Engineering CIS department/program pages; they did not publish 2024/Fall 2024 student headcounts for CS majors, MS-only, or PhD-only. Found a Fall 2024 CIS post mentioning 35 students enrolled in the new AI bachelor\u2019s program, but this is not a \u2018Computer Science\u2019 enrollment count and does not provide CS undergrad/MS/PhD totals, so it was not used. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count is estimated based on R1 university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data. ESTIMATE: grad_cs_count is estimated based on R1 university size and CS department reputation. Will contact university for accurate data.

Per requested schema, b200_count must remain 0, so these are reported under other_high_vram_gpus.\n\n2) CBICA CUBIC (batch nodes): page states 128 GPUs on 64 nodes. Breakdown shown: 20\u00d7 A100 80GB, 26\u00d7 A40 48GB, 4\u00d7 V100, 76\u00d7 P100. These sum to 126, leaving 2 GPUs unaccounted vs the stated total of 128; per instruction to estimate unknowns, those 2 GPUs were estimated as P100 (older GPU in the listed mix). Thus CUBIC batch contributes: A100_80gb=20, V100=4, P100=78 (76 stated + 2 estimated), A40=26 (reported under other_high_vram_gpus due schema forcing a40_count=0).\n\n3) CBICA CUBIC (interactive nodes): 4 servers with 6 GPUs, models not specified; estimated as A40 48GB based on the cluster already containing A40 48GB GPUs. Added under other_high_vram_gpus only (does not affect required model counters).\n\n4) PSOM/PMACS HPC (grant-information page): 2 GPU nodes \u00d7 1 P100/node = 2 P100.\n\nFinal required model totals (summing across included clusters): A100 80GB=20; V100=4; P100=78 (CUBIC batch) + 2 (PSOM/PMACS) = 80. No public sources found for H100/H200/L40s/A6000 counts at UPenn in accessible pages during this crawl; SEAS cluster spec pages appear PennKey-restricted."
