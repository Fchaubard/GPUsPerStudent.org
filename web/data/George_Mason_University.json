Found an official OIEP interactive report (EnrlStsDemo.cfm) whose on-page term selector includes 'Fall 2024 Census' and whose major list includes 'Computer Science - CS', which should contain the needed 2024 CS headcount by level; however, the page could not be reliably accessed/loaded in this retrieval session (timeouts), so no Fall 2024 CS counts could be verified from it. Also found the CS department 'Fast Facts' infographic image (fast-facts_23.jpg) with CS student counts, but it explicitly references 'fiscal year 2022' and degrees conferred '2022-23'/'2021-22', so it was rejected per the requirement to reject 2023 or earlier data."
