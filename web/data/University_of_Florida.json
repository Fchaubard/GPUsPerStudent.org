Includes the original 1,120 GPUs (140 DGX nodes) plus 128 GPUs in standard partitions. Note: 2025 sources indicate the DGX A100s were 'replaced' by B200s, but they are included here as they are likely repurposed within the university rather than discarded.\n3) L4: 600 GPUs added in 2025 to replace older consumer-grade cards."
