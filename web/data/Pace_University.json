    "notes": "Source is Pace University OPAIR 'Pace University Fall 2024 Enrollment Report' dated 23-Oct-2024. It reports enrollment by school (including 'Seidenberg School of CSIS') and level. For Fall 2024, Seidenberg School of CSIS shows Undergraduate Headcount = 575 and Graduate Headcount = 1,707 (Total Headcount = 2,282). Because the report does NOT break Seidenberg down by specific major (Computer Science vs other Seidenberg majors) and does NOT separate graduate enrollment into Master's-only vs PhD, I am only using the Seidenberg undergraduate headcount as a proxy for undergrad CS enrollment, and setting grad_cs_count and phd_cs_count to 0 to comply with the requirement that grad_cs_count must be MS/Masters-only and phd_cs_count must be PhD-only."
