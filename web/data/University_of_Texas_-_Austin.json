These are NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips, which contain H200-class GPU architecture. Both fields are populated to satisfy the 'highest value' rule for available keys, but the total is 600 nodes, not 1200. \n2) LONESTAR6: Contains 84 nodes x 3 A100s (252 total) and 4 nodes x 2 H100 PCIe (8 total). \n3) DECOMMISSIONED SYSTEMS: The V100 (Longhorn/Maverick2) and P100 counts are included based on raw model findings, but notes indicate these systems (Longhorn and Maverick2) were decommissioned/retired around late 2022."

TACC resources (Vista, Lonestar6, Frontera) provide massive scale, though older systems (Longhorn, Maverick2) appear in search results despite decommissioning status. Student counts show significant variance due to the inclusion/exclusion of large online Master's programs; highest credible numbers were merged."
