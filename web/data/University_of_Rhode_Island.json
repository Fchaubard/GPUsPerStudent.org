    "notes": "Searched for URI Computer Science (CS) student enrollment/major headcount specifically for Fall 2024 or AY 2024-2025. URI Office of Institutional Research has a \u201cCount of Majors\u201d dashboard (Power BI) that appears to be the correct/current source for major headcounts, but the embedded Power BI report content (needed to extract the CS major counts for Fall 2024 and to separate MS vs PhD) was not accessible in this environment. The only downloadable \u2018Head Count of Majors (PDF/XLSX)\u2019 files linked on the same IR Enrollment Data page are explicitly limited to Fall 2006\u2013Fall 2020 and therefore were rejected per your date rules. URI\u2019s IR site does provide a 2024-25 Common Data Set PDF link, but CDS does not provide CS major enrollment counts split into undergrad/MS/PhD in a way that meets your request. Result: no acceptable 2024-2025 or Fall 2024 CS enrollment counts could be verified from an explicit 2024+ page, so all counts are set to 0. ESTIMATE: undergrad_cs_count=250, grad_cs_count=100, phd_cs_count=30 are estimated based on university size and CS department presence. Will contact university for accurate data."
